### The History

`Note: This section is for events or statements leading up to Appelbaum's resignation which may be relevant.`

> Highlight of today: Photoshoot at Noisebridge with the talented photographer Peter Yang for Rolling Stone; he's an absolutely awesome guy! ([June 21st 2010](https://archive.is/F9PBY))

![Appelbaum, from Rolling Stone interview](https://archive.li/9bFTl/632f8e6fa77e5b4906fefd5f8bd5a475b5a9de2b.jpg)

The [**Rolling Stone**](https://archive.is/9bFTl) interview from 2010 is one of the few publicly-available accounts of Jacob Appelbaum's early life. Despite [taking issue](https://archive.is/1JYzf#selection-729.0-743.403) with the "[sensationalist](https://archive.is/taU8z)" [title](https://archive.is/M7X9n) post-publication, as far as I'm aware he has never denied the content.

> Appelbaum's obsession with privacy might be explained by the fact that, for his entire childhood, he had absolutely none of it. "I come from a family of lunatics," he says. "Actual, raving lunatics." His parents, who never married, began a 10-year custody battle before he was even born. He spent the first five years of his life with his mother, whom he says is a paranoid schizophrenic. She insisted that Jake had somehow been molested by his father while he was still in the womb. His aunt took custody of him when he was six; two years later she dropped him off at a Sonoma County children's home. It was there, at age eight, that he hacked his first security system. An older kid taught him how to lift the PIN code from a security keypad: You wipe it clean, and the next time a guard enters the code, you blow chalk on the pad and lift the fingerprints. One night, after everyone had gone to sleep, the boys disabled the system and broke out of the facility. They didn't do anything special — just walked around a softball field across the street for half an hour — but Appelbaum remembers the evening vividly: "It was really nice, for a single moment, to be completely free."

> When he was 10, he was assigned by the courts to live with his father, with whom he had remained close. But his dad soon started using heroin, and Appelbaum spent his teens traveling with his father around Northern California on Greyhound buses, living in Christian group homes and homeless shelters. From time to time, his father would rent a house and turn it into a heroin den, subletting every room to fellow addicts. All the spoons in the kitchen had burn stains. One morning, when Appelbaum went to brush his teeth, he found a woman convulsing in the bathtub with a syringe hanging out of her arm. Another afternoon, when he came home from school, he found a suicide note signed by his father. (Appelbaum saved him from an overdose that day, but his father died several years later under mysterious circumstances.) It got so that he couldn't even sit on a couch for fear that he'd be pierced by a stray needle.

> An outsider in his own home, Appelbaum embraced outsider culture. He haunted the Santa Rosa mall, begging for change. He dressed in drag and "I ♥ Satan" T-shirts, dyed his hair purple, picked fights with Christian fundamentalists and made out with boys in front of school. (Appelbaum identifies himself as "queer," though he refers to at least a dozen female lovers in nearly as many countries.) When a friend's father encouraged his interest in computers and taught him basic programming tools, something opened up for Appelbaum. Programming and hacking allowed him "to feel like the world was not a lost place. The Internet is the only reason I'm alive today."

> At 20, he moved to Oakland and eventually began providing tech security for the Rainforest Action Network and Greenpeace. In 2005, a few months after his father died, he traveled alone to Iraq — crossing the border by foot — and set up satellite Internet connections in Kurdistan. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, he drove to New Orleans, using falsified press documents to get past the National Guard, and set up wireless hot spots in one of the city's poorest neighborhoods to enable refugees to register for housing with FEMA.

> Upon returning home, he started experimenting with the fare cards used by the Bay Area Rapid Transit system and discovered it was possible to rig a card with an unlimited fare. Instead of taking advantage, he alerted BART officials to their vulnerabilities. But during this conversation, Appelbaum learned that BART permanently stored the information encoded on every transit card — the credit-card number used, where and when they were swiped — on a private database. Appelbaum was outraged. "Keeping that information around is irresponsible," he says. "I'm a taxpayer, and I was given no choice how they store that data. It's not democratically decided — it's a bureaucratic directive."

> Given his concerns about privacy, it's easy to see why Appelbaum gravitated toward the Tor Project. He volunteered as a programmer, but it soon became clear that his greatest ability lay in proselytizing: He projects the perfect mix of boosterism and dread. "Jake can do advocacy better than most," says Roger Dingledine, one of Tor's founders. "He says, 'If someone were looking for you, this is what they'd do,' and he shows them. It freaks people out."

[Appelbaum](https://archive.is/GItar) officially [joined the Tor Project in 2008](https://web.archive.org/web/20150926185057/https://blog.torproject.org/blog/jacob-and-matt-join-tor-project) as part of the translation team, improving documentation for non-technical users, and advocacy for the Tor network in general. He also [ran one](https://archive.is/K93V5) of Tor's [directory authorities](https://archive.is/7jFmj#selection-4563.0-4569.364) (nicknamed "[urras](https://archive.is/gOZ4g#selection-49481.3-49485.0)"), special servers which maintain a list of all verified exit nodes and help Tor clients find relays in the network; there were [eight of these in 2012](https://archive.is/7jFmj#selection-4567.258-4567.302), [ten in 2014](https://archive.is/HSdAW#selection-1089.35-1091.21), [nine as of today](https://archive.is/uU7Ft). The hostname for the server was [rgnx.net](https://archive.is/fojzV), with the IP address `208.83.223.34`, which was a [target](https://archive.is/jFoiM#selection-9.985-9.998) of the [NSA's XKeyscore (XKS)](https://archive.is/bJxB7) system as revealed by [an investigation published by **Das Erste**](https://archive.is/http://daserste.ndr.de/panorama/aktuell/nsa230_*) in 2014.

> [Obwohl er keinen Hochschulabschluss vorweisen konnte, bekam er 2010 an der Universität Washington einen Job als Forscher und IT-Sicherheitsexperte](https://archive.is/zE8YD#selection-1083.315-1083.462). [Although he possessed no university degree, in 2010 he got a job at the University of Washington as a researcher and IT security expert.] [Doch weil er nicht aufhörte, Julian Assange öffentlich zu unterstützen und vor Bespitzelung zu warnen, verlor er 2012 den Job](https://archive.is/zE8YD#selection-1083.463-1083.589). [But because he didn't stop publicly supporting Julian Assange and warning against spying, he lost the job in 2012.].

On December 27th 2012, founder [Asher Wolf](https://archive.is/v8mHW) [quit as an organizer of **CryptoParty**](https://archive.is/OtPoB), a [grassroots initiative to educate the general public](https://archive.is/CK2kM) on [digital privacy-enhancing tools](https://archive.is/fjKhl), which at the time was [just four months old](https://archive.is/yrSKy). She said "[quitting wasn't easy](https://archive.is/SJLQF)" and cited [a general lack of respect from several people in the movement who took advantage of **CryptoParty**'s decentralized structure](https://archive.is/OxmkN), which in some cases [put attendees at risk](https://archive.is/nyDQo). One day later she [published](https://archive.is/lIRu1) a [blog post](https://archive.is/fDxKU) with further explanation as to why she left. The 'final straw' was [a series of interactions](https://archive.is/fDxKU#selection-555.0-623.76) surrounding the [**Chaos Communication Congress** in December 2012](https://archive.is/KoKyX) (29c3), particularly regarding former [London **CryptoParty**](https://archive.is/CQ8ju#selection-3195.66-3205.23) [organizer](https://archive.is/7Ds0w#selection-5079.1-5089.37) [Samuel Carlisle](https://archive.is/4NWeP), aka "[Sam the Techie](https://web.archive.org/web/20110716002931/http://samthetechie.com/index.php?id=Contact)," who allegedly [failed to complete a contract](https://archive.is/oFutb) of [building a website for her after she paid him AUS$700](https://archive.is/Jc7Ct). When he [traveled to Hamburg on December 24th](https://archive.is/ruwwk) for his first Congress, as an [Angel](https://archive.is/w5yXf#selection-887.1-903.11) [volunteer](https://archive.is/XiR8p) and [Lightning Talk](https://youtu.be/eao8yBKHYT8?t=1h29m8s) speaker, she [encouraged others](https://archive.is/L57QI) to [confront him](https://archive.is/Sj67s) on her behalf. As a result of the [attention](https://archive.is/fDxKU#selection-635.0-651.137) on the dispute and [the](https://archive.is/UiFOf) [controversy](https://archive.is/ZW6we) over [someone's](https://archive.is/Eup9E) [retaliation](https://archive.is/MkTzm) for the "Creepercard" (or [Red/Yellow card](https://archive.is/qTHN7)) activity, Carlisle claims [he was removed from the volunteer team](https://archive.is/ZdiNq#selection-945.0-945.253) and Wolf became a [doxing target](https://archive.is/9eGPN), which she implied was [his fault](https://archive.is/HJOBY). [Web developer](https://archive.is/KEPGx) [Daniel Sieradski](https://archive.is/JSxKP) ([@selfagency](https://archive.is/7eFdH)) helped her [get it back online](https://archive.is/3mKfh) and [finished creating the website](https://archive.is/kEdGU), [free of charge](https://archive.is/fDxKU#selection-571.1-571.98). Despite Carlisle's [public](https://archive.is/3O9Ib) [apology](https://archive.is/ZdiNq), Wolf's positive [reference letter](https://archive.is/uwy3t) for [his MIT application](https://archive.is/ZdiNq#selection-577.1-601.137) (as well as previous [commendation for his work for **CryptoParty**](https://archive.is/OoLXJ#selection-599.1-599.244)), [offers](https://archive.is/MqKBH#selection-5239.1-5239.49) [to](https://archive.is/ugixV) [refund](https://archive.is/BSMV1) via [bank transfer](https://archive.is/UKNGw), and supposedly [more than one person](https://archive.is/lOh7Q#selection-6625.1-6625.101) willing to [act as an intermediary](https://archive.is/zvm4u), the dispute was never resolved. 

Appelbaum was also [mentioned in her blog post](https://archive.is/fDxKU#selection-491.0-519.272) regarding a conversation they'd had on the **Liberation Tech** mailing list in early October, the topic of which was [her technical abilities and willingness to learn](https://mailman.stanford.edu/pipermail/liberationtech/2012-October/005086.html). In response to her assertion that she didn't "[have the right skill set](https://archive.is/xbGvm#selection-577.66-581.28)," he encouraged her not to '[demoralize](https://archive.is/xbGvm#selection-597.49-601.72)' herself, which she misinterpreted as criticism; he [clarified](https://archive.is/r3kjk#selection-659.1-659.622) that [he believed in her willingness to learn](https://archive.is/fDxKU#selection-7119.0-7119.449). She also [criticised his recommendation of PrivateGSM](https://archive.is/fDxKU#selection-523.0-527.31) ([software for making encrypted phone calls](https://archive.is/x05hV)) at a **CryptoParty** and how he later backed out. In the comments he explained that [he'd had a new device](https://archive.is/fDxKU#selection-6929.0-6929.490) and wasn't able to "[hack it together](https://archive.is/fDxKU#selection-7113.0-7113.466)" in time. The misunderstanding was [resolved](https://archive.is/LhRi2) again and she said his response was "[supportive and constructive](https://archive.is/6pSjn#selection-3575.1-3575.96)." Following the end of the Congress, Appelbaum [organized a crowdfund for Wolf](https://archive.is/nNIfy) through [ChipIn](https://web.archive.org/web/20130104094951/http://supportasherwolf.chipin.com/asherwolf-conflict-resolution) to recover the AUS$700, [half of which he supposedly donated himself](https://archive.is/xTPO2). 

> [I think we should raise $700 for @Asher_Wolf and then try to build consensus on future strategies for conflict resolutions.](https://archive.is/bCeUR) [While rasing money to remediate @Asher_Wolf's capital losses doesn't solve all problems, I hope it eases class division pressure.](https://archive.is/0aKZ9) [Lest anyone think otherwise - the cash for @Asher_Wolf is merely to offset her loses and not meant to interrupt the dialog about sexism.](https://archive.is/3kvvk)

[Within a day](https://archive.is/e2YK7) the fundraiser [surpassed $500](https://archive.is/OYrtM) and soon [ended with a total of $885](https://archive.is/EQyrc) from [about thirty donors](https://archive.is/dqBkZ), at which point [Appelbaum closed the campaign](https://archive.is/59Ls3) at [Wolf's request](https://archive.is/tQfEE). Responding to [Carlisle's worry that the campaign insinuated his guilt](https://archive.is/azEC6#selection-3937.1-3937.125), Appelbaum said it was not an "[absolute condemnation](https://archive.is/WpBln#selection-3941.61-3941.82)" of him and made "[no judgement](https://archive.is/azEC6#selection-4305.8-4305.19)" on the matter because he "[didn't know the details](https://archive.is/3O9Ib#selection-3755.108-3755.127)" and hoped this would "[make peace possible](https://archive.is/azEC6#selection-4315.39-4315.58)." Wolf voiced displeasure that [Appelbaum](https://archive.is/f5ZjF#selection-6267.1-6277.41) [hadn't consulted with her prior to launching the campaign](https://archive.is/f5ZjF#selection-9869.2-9869.96), that there wasn't a "[strategy](https://archive.is/f5ZjF#selection-10567.12-10567.117)," and she [felt pressured](https://archive.is/f5ZjF#selection-11589.1-11589.59) to [express gratitude](https://archive.is/umKVV#selection-6615.1-6615.108). She was [unable to refuse donations](https://archive.is/2p1Jw#selection-8251.1-8251.74) and claimed [**PayPal** froze her account](https://archive.is/2p1Jw#selection-9991.1-9991.118).

> [If by "screwed up" you mean someone decided to earnestly attempt to fix a problem without discussing it with me](https://archive.is/cru0j) [and now I can't access my PayPal account as a result and I can't issue refunds because the account is frozen, well yes.](https://archive.is/2U36r) [It was all very well-meaning 'tho, we all know that.](https://archive.is/l9WD0)

Appelbaum said his effort to reimburse Wolf "[wasn't trying to make her whole. The goal was to return the amount of money she invested until the dispute can be solved](https://archive.is/wiber#selection-4231.1-4231.124)."

Amidst this [discussion about the crowdfund for Wolf](https://archive.is/Sb4s0), technology researcher and writer [Meredith Patterson](https://web.archive.org/web/20160325052441/http://www.thesmartpolitenerd.com/aboutme.html) ([@maradydd](https://archive.is/1FYbO)) surfaced allegations of plagiarism against Appelbaum. She has yet to provide details on what research was plagiarized, only saying later in [October 2014 that a talk of his](https://archive.is/9cBQN#selection-6183.58-6193.0) for the ['*Nothing to Hide*' Chaos Comunication Congress in 2008](https://archive.is/eOZVC) (25C3) was stolen from her, her [now deceased husband](https://archive.is/pZy3O) [Len Sassaman](https://archive.is/2S6xg), and [American security researcher](https://archive.is/RBkNS) [Dan Kaminsky](https://archive.is/tFs3a) ([@dakami](https://twitter.com/dakami)). The "research" allegedly stolen was [oral discussions](https://archive.is/qDCjS#selection-3131.7-3131.98) between the three [during the previous Congress (24C3)](https://archive.is/ADGlp#selection-3157.0-3187.16) in [2007](https://archive.is/xuuCG#selection-3877.99-3877.131). [Appelbaum's talks for 25C3](https://archive.is/ZegZe) were '[Building An International Movement: hackerspaces.org](https://archive.is/mULaP)', '[Advanced Memory Forensics: The Cold Boot Attacks](https://archive.is/GqBjE)' (solo), and '[MD5 Considered Harmful Today](https://archive.is/9koyI).' Patterson says [Appelbaum apologized to her](https://archive.is/xuuCG) during [Sassaman's wake](https://archive.is/uZ6WI) at the [DNA Lounge](https://archive.is/l48by) and she not only [acknowledged Appelbaum's apology](https://archive.is/e8CIg#selection-6649.1-6649.118) but admitted that [Sassaman forgave him](https://archive.is/SJZFw#selection-6695.56-6695.71) and [she unexpectedly backtracked on her acceptance](https://archive.is/Sb4s0#selection-7721.1-7721.113) due to [unresolved anger](https://archive.is/Sb4s0#selection-8431.1-8431.85); she also apologized for her "[entirely](https://archive.is/Sb4s0#selection-9141.105-9141.113) [passive-aggressive](https://archive.is/Hit0Z#selection-6667.5-6667.54)" attempt a [resolving](https://archive.is/e8CIg#selection-7033.49-7033.103) it by [writing negatively about him in Hacker News](https://archive.is/Sb4s0#selection-6637.1-6637.99). In addition to [frequent friendly discussions on usability, security, and legal issues](https://archive.is/LCTtn) (including [offering research help](https://archive.is/r0otF#selection-1727.1-1737.58)), Sassaman in fact had [expressed](https://archive.is/nlHIq) [support](https://archive.is/HTNQr) [for Appelbaum](https://archive.is/0IaBJ) [in 2011](https://archive.is/ysFlR) after he was repeatedly detained and interrogated [by US CBP at the airport](https://archive.is/oKzf1).

> [There might be short-term benefit through appeasement, by remaining silent, but it can only hurt overall.](https://archive.is/ReC1Z) [That said, having had to choose in the past btwn not poking the hornets nest, vs. shining light on it, I get that it's difficult.](https://archive.is/fwzmi) [So, thank you, Jake, for speaking up.](https://archive.is/lMxqs)

The issue was [raised again](https://twitter.com/ioerror/status/302261054497509376) in [February 2013](https://archive.is/ADGlp) over [mpOTR software](https://web.archive.org/web/20160605152831/http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.otr.devel/1546) (which was [already being resolved](https://archive.is/6auiA#selection-3165.1-3165.91)). She said Appelbaum was "[playing fast and loose with attribution](https://archive.is/XXF0F#selection-7097.16-7097.55)" and that his apology to Sassaman had been [dishonest](https://archive.is/6auiA#selection-5939.28-5939.116) and [manipulative](https://archive.is/XXF0F#selection-9609.1-9609.61) because Len's "[forgiveness was contingent upon Jake keeping his nose squeaky clean with regards to attribution. He hasn't](https://archive.is/knbDT#selection-5671.1-5681.98)." She did not specify what the new allegations of plagiarism were. She also accused Appelbaum of being a [kleptomaniac](https://archive.is/8JKs0), [harassing Kaminsky](https://archive.is/fWEnf) and lying about the date of his apology to Sassaman: Appelbaum said [they "made up" at **Noisebridge**](https://archive.is/28kIq#selection-4949.1-4949.84), whereas Patterson was only aware of a [reconciliation](https://archive.is/r61AJ#selection-4949.1-4949.126) through [IM](https://archive.is/knbDT#selection-4937.1-4937.126) weeks before his [suicide](https://archive.is/fxXV) on [July](https://archive.is/tHqj6) [3rd](https://archive.is/YO5eK) after [battling chronic depression and degenerative pain](https://archive.is/KoCKm). Appelbaum [apologized again](https://archive.is/6auiA#selection-6299.1-6299.36) even though [he did not agree](https://archive.is/Sn5cP#selection-4263.71-4263.117) [with her story](https://archive.is/MJzhn#selection-4197.1-4197.96). The issue has [continued](https://archive.is/AK00O#selection-6779.0-6779.78) to [briefly surface](https://archive.is/Y1bR1#selection-6029.17-6029.32) since.

During the [OHM](https://web.archive.org/web/20160313213308/https://ohm2013.org/site/) ("[Observe. Make. Hack.](https://web.archive.org/web/20151012105257/https:/twitter.com/ohm2013)") hacker camping festival in the [Netherlands](https://web.archive.org/web/20160723093620/https:/twitter.com/Asher_Wolf/status/361818080852185088), Wolf [personally confronted](https://web.archive.org/web/20160723090042/https:/twitter.com/Asher_Wolf/status/362996336485867521) [Carlisle](https://web.archive.org/web/20160723090905/https:/twitter.com/samthetechie/status/362418803528839168) and again [told him to pay her back](https://web.archive.org/web/20160723092302/https:/twitter.com/Asher_Wolf/status/362851225177305088) the [AUS$700](https://web.archive.org/web/20160723093218/https:/twitter.com/Asher_Wolf/status/362857221903761408) (it has been [alleged that at some point Patterson attacked him with a hammer](https://archive.is/OIK0V#selection-215.4249-215.4332); while [she was indeed at OHM](https://web.archive.org/web/20160723094024/https://twitter.com/Asher_Wolf/status/362583498462216195), there is no further mention of this anywhere or how it is [related](https://web.archive.org/web/20160723094557/https:/twitter.com/puellavulnerata/status/747176641626013696) to [Appelbaum](https://web.archive.org/web/20160723095240/https:/twitter.com/search?vertical=default&q=%40ioerror%20%23OHM2013&src=typd)). On July 31st, the official start of the OHM festival, Carlisle tweeted for the last time to [announce that he was quitting Twitter](https://web.archive.org/web/20160723091129/https:/twitter.com/samthetechie/status/362516877236375553).

At the [**Chaos Communication Congress**](https://archive.is/FQsDm) in December of 2014 (31c3), Appelbaum and then [Tor Project director](https://archive.is/WTt5r#selection-247.0-247.54) [Roger Dingledine](https://twitter.com/RogerDingledine) presented the "[State of the Onion](https://media.ccc.de/v/31c3_-_6251_-_en_-_saal_1_-_201412301400_-_state_of_the_onion_-_jacob_-_arma)." Three minutes in, Appelbaum started speaking about "[a sustained campaign of online harassment](https://archive.is/iyJKZ)" which had been [directed](https://archive.is/ljqM4) at [core Tor developer](https://archive.is/Q2TTK#selection-739.0-739.25) [Andrea Shepard](https://archive.is/yF1cg) "for the past several months." 

> APPELBAUM: It is the case that there's a person in our community, and many persons in our community, that have come under attack and have been deeply harassed. We think that sucks and we don't like that. Even though we promote anonymity without any question, that is no backdoors ever (and we'll get back to that in a minute), it is the case that we really want to promote being excellent to each other (in the spirit of Noisebridge). [...] It isn't the case that we're saying you shouldn't have the right to say things, but we are saying "get the fuck out of our community" if you're going to be abusive to women.

> And you'll note that I used the word "fuck" to say it; I'm sorry about that because the point is we all make mistakes and we want to make sure that, while it's true that we have transgressions, we want to make sure that we can find a place of reconcilliation and we can work towards conflict resolution. It's important at the same time to recognize that there are people whose real lives are harmed by harassment online. In this case, one of the people is in this audience and I hope that they won't mind be named, but we want to give her a shout-out and say that we stand behind her a hundred percent.

> DINGLEDINE: One of our developers on core Tor, Andrea, has been harassed on Twitter and elsewhere, really a lot more than should happen to anybody. 

> [...] She's not just being attacked because she happens to be there, she's being attacked because they're trying to attack the Tor Project and all the other people in Tor; so yes, she may be the focus of some of the attacks but we, the rest of the Tor community, the rest of the security community, need to stand up and take on some of this burden of communicating, interacting and talk about these issues. We can't just leave it to her to defend herself.

As Appelbaum followed up with, [the](https://archive.is/Da9Mu) [harassment](https://archive.is/3yp8b) seemed to center on the topic of [Tor's creation](https://archive.is/QNyQ7) and [funding from the U.S. government](https://archive.is/OQlhR), a debate which has been raging since the software became more widely used by the public. While Shepard is said to have received the brunt of the harassment, on her [blog](https://archive.is/AaYqn) she [details several other people, including Appelbaum](https://archive.is/AaYqn#selection-1467.0-1467.867), connected to Tor who were similarly harassed.

According to national security researcher and journalist [Alexa O'Brien](https://archive.is/nHFae), who claims to have spoken with Appelbaum on the subject at the event, he was "sympathetic to [retribution] against the troll."

Based on a [letter](https://archive.is/5zlA0) published by [**Golem.de**](https://archive.is/J7rxB) through [**FearlessBlogging.com**](https://archive.is/aVULh) (an anonymous blog site), Tor Project's then [human relations manager](https://archive.is/Q2TTK#selection-515.0-515.12) [Tom Leckrone](https://archive.is/rYKWV) (who still [contributes to the mailing list](https://archive.is/Of5TC)) wrote to Appelbaum on March 18th 2015 that he was "expected to engage... on performance and conduct issues" as part of a Performance Improvement Plan following "an unpaid suspension for a period of ten business days" from March 20th to March 30th. The suspension was due to incidents which took place on March 3rd and 6th during a [core Tor team company meeting](https://archive.is/DrGwH) in Valencia, Spain. (This was also the week of the [**Circumvention Tech Festival**](https://archive.is/9klki), during which Appelbaum [tweeted](https://archive.is/ooFR7) they needed help identifying a [suspicious GPS tracking device](https://archive.is/tbdfC) found on an [attendee's](https://archive.is/KDYAy) vehicle.) The letter states:

> As you know, a community member advanced a complaint that included two separate instances. One of the instances involved a provocative conversation on the afternoon of March 6th. The person to whom you were speaking was not offended, but the provocative conversation could be overheard by others and created an unwelcoming environment.

> The other incident raises more serious concerns regarding Tor Project’s obligation to ensure a safe and comfortable work environment, especially as regards an environment that is unwelcoming or hostile to protected classes of community members. In this case, you made statements that implied that new community members were recruited in a sexually charged manner. This was made during the course of a Tor Project-sanctioned work session which you took part in leading. The very statement that the inception of a working relationship was in any way influenced by sexual conduct or even innuendo is offensive, especially in an environment where Tor Project is actively working to ensure that all community members are able to engage and advance themselves based on their skills and willingness to contribute rather than other attributes.

> ... In the repartee that followed, you expressly stated that the offensive sexualized recruitment “strategy” had “worked” with the complainant. This statement created an inappropriate and unwelcome environment for the complainant, and, indeed, any bystander who overheard this statement would be likely to perceive that the work environment at Tor Project was not welcoming and supportive of merit-based work.

He also warned Appelbaum that he should resign if he didn't want to follow the terms of suspension or the Performance Improvement Plan; even if he did comply, he could have his employment terminated if "[further performance or conduct issues ensue](https://archive.is/5zlA0#selection-315.0-315.402)." It may be relevant that Appelbaum was [told to contact Executive Director Andrew Lewman](https://archive.is/5zlA0#selection-323.0-323.81), who had been with the Tor Project [since 2009](https://archive.is/XVYVt#selection-115.15-115.102) and then chose to [leave](https://archive.is/uC18m) less than a month after this letter was sent (the position was [filled](https://archive.is/cKnF2) by Roger Dingledine in May of that year). The stated reason was that he left to work with "an Internet services company," which is rather euphemistic considering it was actually [two](https://archive.is/OZkQV), [**Inman Technology**](https://archive.is/DRYbZ#selection-669.50-669.232) and [**Norse Corporation**](https://archive.is/LdGRr), both of which are information technology companies [with ties to the intelligence sector](https://archive.is/OZkQV#selection-1921.2-1927.78) (which was probably [negatively received](https://archive.is/52OED)).

According to [**Buzzfeed**](https://archive.is/wvbwZ) (who spoke with yet unnamed sources) the "community member" who advanced the complaint which precipitated this letter was then [Development Director Karen Reilly](https://archive.is/WTt5r#selection-673.0-673.34) (oddly not listed under past contributors, while [Lewman](https://archive.is/RPj8I#selection-411.0-411.40) is; this is [the last archived page](https://web.archive.org/web/20150416074507/https://www.torproject.org/about/corepeople.html.en) she appears in).

> She told [the board of the Tor Project] about Appelbaum’s public and false claims that he had sex with a specific member of the Tor community — something multiple sources have told BuzzFeed News Appelbaum has “done to too many people to count.” And she told them of darker allegations against him that had come up after a group of disgusted Tor community members gathered to share stories.

> ...According to sources, Appelbaum’s behavior had been the talk of the conference. Reilly had separately approached Lewman, Dingledine, Mathewson, and Seltzer in Valencia and told them of the harassment.

> At dinner, the conversation turned to Appelbaum after Gardner, not yet a Tor employee, broached the subject. According to a source with knowledge of the dinner, Gardner said her friends had been asking her why she was working with an organization that employs a rapist. After that, Reilly “rehashed everything.”

> ... Following the dinner, according to sources, Tor conducted a human resources inquiry into the matter.

Like Appelbaum, Reilly was also given a ten-day suspension, but for "[spreading rumors about the Tor Project](https://archive.is/wvbwZ#selection-2959.100-2959.217)." It is not stated what kind of rumours, about whom, or by what [medium](https://archive.is/qMQU7). Unlike Appelbaum, she didn't take the offer and left; no mention was made of her departure in Tor Project blog announcements. As late as [October 2014](https://archive.is/w6DEK), Reilly had defended Tor for dealing effectively with these kinds of issues. A year later to the day, she wrote a [blog post](https://archive.is/61e8T) reflecting that she now thought otherwise:

> If I had the power to remove the sexual harassers and misogynists from our midst, don’t you think I would have done so already? The problem is that I don’t have the power. If I worked for the sort of industry that removed awful men, I would have the power to remove awful men. If I say something, I’m the hysterical bitch who just wants to create drama. If I oppose an abuser openly, I become a target along with the people I care about.

**Golem.de** claims they have confirmed the authenticity of the letter ("... [die Echtheit der Mail bestätigt](https://archive.is/J7rxB#selection-547.109-547.219)."), though the submitter remains anonymous and the Tor Project has [not confirmed it](https://archive.is/vM92Z#selection-4191.1-4201.77). **Ars Technica** Senior Business Editor and journalist [Cyrus Farivar](https://web.archive.org/web/20160602030108/http://arstechnica.com/author/cyrus-farivar/) has [also published](https://archive.is/vVDQC) a copy of the [internal email](https://web.archive.org/web/20160610033307/https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2858268/Appelbaum-Wurde-Im-Jahr-2015-Ausgesetzt.pdf), which he said was [sent to him anonymously](https://archive.is/vM92Z#selection-3259.8-3259.19).

On the 17th and 18th (when Leckrone sent the suspension email), Appelbaum tweeted:

> I wonder what the best defenses are for JTRIG-ish psyops? Just buckle in and move slow? Refuse to be split? Refuse to be atomized? ([March 17th](https://archive.is/nW5Is))


> That feeling that manifests when it is time to move on. Intensely. ([March 18th](https://archive.is/1vhhn))

![JTRIG chart](https://archive.li/kDzXc/b2a926bb585face74776c6ccd5343e831cb4dc43.png)

"[JTRIG](https://archive.is/zhdGz)" is the acronym for a unit of GCHQ, the **Joint Threat Research Intelligence Group**, which uses psychological manipulation tactics to infiltrate and destroy activist groups by understanding, shaping, and controlling how discourse unfolds. The **Human Science Operations Cell** (HSOC) is a division of GCHQ which focuses on online human intelligence. Documents outlining their purpose and methods were among those [leaked by Edward Snowden](https://archive.is/5v3pP) (with which [Appelbaum was closely involved](https://archive.is/skoYv)) and subsequently published through media outlets with access to the archives. In [February 2014](https://archive.is/kDzXc), Glenn Greenwald released a series of documents on JTRIG, including "[The Art of Deception: Training for a New Generation of Online Covert Operations](https://theintercept.com/document/2014/02/24/art-deception-training-new-generation-online-covert-operations/)," in which they outline their goals to create "cyber magicians" who can manipulate targets at individual, group, and global levels using social psychology.

> Among the core self-identified purposes of JTRIG are two tactics: **(1)** to inject all sorts of false material onto the internet in order to destroy the reputation of its targets; and **(2)** to use social sciences and other techniques to manipulate online discourse and activism to generate outcomes it considers desirable. To see how extremist these programs are, just consider the tactics they boast of using to achieve those ends: “false flag operations” (posting material to the internet and falsely attributing it to someone else), fake victim blog posts (pretending to be a victim of the individual whose reputation they want to destroy), and posting “negative information” on various forums. 

On June 24th, **VICE News** Senior Investigative Reporter [Jason Leopold](https://archive.is/IqpAt) and O'Brien [jointly filed](https://web.archive.org/web/20160722225356/https://twitter.com/JasonLeopold/status/614090844782657537) a [FOIA lawsuit](https://web.archive.org/web/20160722224006/https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2110787-leopold-obrien-foia-lawsuit-jacob-applebaum.html) against [nineteen US federal agencies](https://web.archive.org/web/20160722222056/https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2110787/leopold-obrien-foia-lawsuit-jacob-applebaum.pdf) for [documents](https://web.archive.org/web/20160722231229/https:/twitter.com/ioerror/status/614028633385107456) related to the "ongoing U.S. criminal
investigation of WikiLeaks, Assange, and other civilians, including Mr. Appelbaum." The [first amended complaint](https://web.archive.org/web/20160722221927/https://cryptome.org/2016/06/leopold-obrien-006.pdf) was filed on August 9th. The request has yet to be fulfilled but [may be nearing completion](https://web.archive.org/web/20160722225143/https:/twitter.com/Cryptomeorg/status/756434419578200064).

In [early April 2016](https://archive.is/UNxr6), Appelbaum visited North Korea for [seven days](https://archive.is/qIWWz#selection-1113.0-1113.43) as part of a guided tour group of nine other Americans with the [Korean International Travel Company](https://archive.is/qIWWz#selection-1077.69-1077.105), supposedly after [receiving offers](https://archive.is/fXuKk) sometime in [January](https://archive.is/z4M1R). Though he never publicly announced he was going, he can be seen in the group pictures from a [personal essay](https://archive.is/qIWWz) written by [**PBS Newshour** producer](https://archive.is/4msEB) [Hannah Yi](https://archive.is/Qop6H), as well as the [tour video](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https://vimeo.com/172360421) uploaded [anonymously](https://archive.is/uy8bI) to **Vimeo** between the 26th and 27th of June (Vimeo later took it down, but I had saved an .mp4 copy and [re-uploaded it here](http://vimple.co/04506a053f124483b8fb05ed73899f19)). Other than Appelbaum making an appearance, what is shown in the video matches pictures shared by Yi in the essay, such as [the soccer game at the Rungrado 1st of May stadium in Pyongyang](https://archive.is/qIWWz#selection-915.55-1193.98) and the [bronze statues at the Mansudae Grand Monument](https://archive.is/qIWWz#selection-915.55-1165.108). It has been alleged that this trip [may have led to insecurity within Tor about maintaining funding](https://archive.is/OIK0V#selection-215.2475-215.2578).

![North Korea tour group (Appelbaum on the far left)](http://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/2016-04-18-10.30.01.jpg)

On April 13th, Appelbaum [delivered](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJValv4YQcY) a [speech](https://archive.is/FrTlr) he self-described as "journalistic suicide" at the [**Logan Center for Investigative Journalism** (CIJ) Symposium](https://archive.is/ZgsyC) (where he is an [advisor](https://archive.is/iOm5e#selection-311.0-311.15)) in Berlin, Germany. During the speech he outlined how he and other investigative journalists had been betrayed by establishment journalists, particularly at **The Guardian** which he called the "[shittiest publication in the English language](https://archive.is/FrTlr#selection-1729.0-1743.1)," to the point where their lives were at risk.

![Appelbaum at CIJ event](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CdTV8ArUIAAmpSk.jpg:large)


### The Resignation

On June 2nd, 2016, Tor Project [Executive Director](https://archive.is/Q2TTK#selection-767.0-767.32) [Shari Steele](https://archive.is/B8rRs) posted a ["transition" update](https://web.archive.org/web/20160603213021/https://blog.torproject.org/blog/jacob-appelbaum-leaves-tor-project) on the organization's blog:

> Long time digital advocate, security researcher, and developer Jacob Appelbaum stepped down from his position at The Tor Project on May 25, 2016.

Shortly before the transition update was published, Dingledine allegedly [sent out an email to the Tor-internal mailing list](https://web.archive.org/web/20160628002000/https://cryptome.org/2016/06/dingledine-appelbaum-16-0602.pdf) with more detail about Appelbaum's resignation (which was [originally leaked on June 5th](https://archive.is/u6iOS) and [republished](https://archive.is/bylE6) and mirrored by [**Cryptome.org**](https://archive.is/isP0T#selection-269.0-268.1) on [June 27th](https://archive.is/4vY5N)). The email outlines who will be the [points of contact](https://archive.is/bylE6#selection-215.5302-215.5597), reassures them they are still working on [drafting documents for company and community policy](https://archive.is/bylE6#selection-215.5599-215.6201) and that [Tor-the-company will survive this](https://archive.is/bylE6#selection-215.6203-215.6565), and urges them to "[be mindful](https://archive.is/bylE6#selection-215.7704-215.7737)" about how they talk to the public or engage in "[twitterwar](https://archive.is/bylE6#selection-215.7820-215.7830)." No one from Tor has yet confirmed whether the email is authentic.

A few days later, Appelbaum's name was [removed from the list](https://archive.is/yxqlC) of core Tor Project employees and volunteers. Someone has also [quietly deleted](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/what-tor-supporter-looks-%E2%80%93-jacob-appelbaum) [blog posts on Appelbaum](https://web.archive.org/web/20160304052552/https://blog.torproject.org/blog/what-tor-supporter-looks-%E2%80%93-jacob-appelbaum). However, he still appeared to [have control over his Tor directory authority](https://archive.is/K93V5). On July 1st, Dingledine emailed a plan to drop 'urras', a process which requires [at least five](https://archive.is/LzgfS#selection-83.785-83.895) of the [nine other directory authorities](https://archive.is/7lJ4c) to agree in consensus, including [at least one of three DAs which votes on recommended verions](https://archive.is/LzgfS#selection-83.1243-83.1354): '[moria1](https://archive.is/V0WKc)' controlled by Dingledine, '[gabelmoo](https://archive.is/EaZdS)' controlled by [developer](https://archive.is/yxqlC#selection-367.0-367.25) [Sebastian Hahn](https://archive.is/HESIE) (shown to be [targeted by the NSA's XKeyscore program](https://archive.is/gU88G#selection-1699.0-1705.154) in [2014](https://archive.is/Xx4hr)), and '[tor26](https://archive.is/OiSgs)' controlled by [sysadmin and developer](https://archive.is/yxqlC#selection-647.0-647.39) [Peter Palfrader](https://archive.is/UwKjE). On July 5th, the [process](https://archive.is/qBZO4) for [removing 'urras'](https://archive.is/uU7Ft) was complete.

![info on urras directory authority](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CmW9AiTXgAAANpg.jpg)

On the 24th of May 2016, one day before Appelbaum stepped down, [core Tor developer](https://archive.is/Q2TTK#selection-739.0-739.25) [Andrea Shepard](https://archive.is/ol0mQ) tweeted a [commitment hash](https://web.archive.org/web/20160603213504/https://twitter.com/puellavulnerata/status/735230102154448898) (i.e. [making a statement of secret value which can be authentically revealed in the future](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Commitment_scheme)). Within the same day that Steele announced Appelbaum's departure, Shepard [revealed the hash](https://archive.is/V0hZw#selection-26133.0-26133.78):

> [@puellavulnerata](https://archive.is/V0hZw): Precommitment revealed: sha256("It seems one rapist is one rapist too many\n")

(To verify this yourself using OpenSSL, type `echo It seems one rapist is one rapist too many | openssl sha256`, the output of which should be `(stdin)= bfb9a7c833a5fc8f5a938d816b1bbc4acaa06519fdb1af4c8632719596807dac`).

The **Eindhoven Institute for the Protection of Systems and Information** (Ei/PSI) also published the schedule of speakers for their "[Security in Times of Surveillance](https://web.archive.org/web/20160506055357/http://www.win.tue.nl/eipsi/surveillance.html)" event on May 26th. Sometime between [the 24th and the 26th](https://archive.is/vhO8h#selection-2149.0-2177.6), Appelbaum's talk "Beyond End-to-End Encryption" was [cancelled](https://archive.is/JzF0j#selection-443.0-449.15), the reason only noted as "sickness."

On May 27th, Steele reportedly [requested that Appelbaum sign a resignation agreement](https://web.archive.org/web/20160608122942/https://cryptome.org/2016/06/tor-appelbaum-separation.pdf) in which he would promise "[mutual non-disparagement](https://archive.is/FP1GE)," including giving up the right to sue the Tor Project. According to the attached explanation by [**Cryptome.org**](https://cryptome.org/), Appelbaum refused to sign the agreement.

As people responded to the news about Appelbaum as well as these mysterious tweets, it became clear that they were connected after Patterson tweeted about [the lack of explanation in Steele's announcement](https://archive.is/1FYbO#selection-5199.0-5213.107).

> [blog.torproject.org/blog/jacob-appelbaum-leaves-tor-project](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/jacob-appelbaum-leaves-tor-project) is a gross disservice to the Tor community. People deserve to know why Tor evicted its resident sociopath. You don't just kick sociopaths down the road and play like you've done the necessary. That's extending their social license to operate. Tor had the chance to nip this in the bud back when Jake was just a plagiarist. They ignored it, and he graduated to sexual assault... Jake finally raped enough people that Tor as an organisation couldn't ignore it anymore.

As background to her assertion that he "graduated [from plagiarist] to sexual assault," it would be relevant to note that Patterson and Appelbaum have a history of being involved in plagiarism disputes (see '[History](https://github.com/Enegnei/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor/blob/master/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor.md#the-history)'), where Appelbaum was the accused, extending back prior to the passing of her husband Len Sassaman in 2011 (mentioned in [this thread](https://twitter.com/ioerror/status/302261054497509376) as "Len"). She recently [tweeted her account](https://archive.is/xuuCG) of an interaction with Appelbaum which followed that particular dispute, and [then said](https://archive.is/laWvR) that "Jake hasn't apologised to any of his assault/harassment victims that I know of either. And to everyone else trying to make hay out of that distinction, hairsplitting isn't a good look on you." American journalist [Quinn Norton](https://archive.is/GIttq) also joined her in [claiming involvement in plagiarism disputes](https://archive.is/5Sywt) with Appelbuam. They have yet to directly specify, or present evidence of, what work he plagiarised. In Patterson's case she probably won't ever do so, since she's [already told one inquirer](https://archive.is/q4PbR) (who [challenged how she defined 'plagiarism'](https://archive.is/qDCjS#selection-3485.1-3485.118)) that "[when research that gets stolen was only communicated about orally, there is no paper trail](https://archive.is/qDCjS#selection-3131.7-3131.98)." [Kaminsky](https://archive.is/AK00O), one of the alleged victims, was also [unwilling to provide details](https://archive.is/qkoTS#selection-4929.1-4929.97). [**Cryptocat**](https://web.archive.org/web/20160614234138/https://crypto.cat/mission.html) developer [Nadim Kobeissi](https://archive.is/CIb0I) has also [argued with Appelbaum](https://archive.is/ub4CH) in the past with regards to [attribution rights](https://archive.is/VlKC6), but outside of [one tweet](https://archive.is/GW6T0) on the subject has stayed out of the debate because he "[thought a bit more about things and decided I had better things to emotionally invest myself in than an angry riot](https://archive.is/tPnaQ)." 

The majority of those who responded were [shocked and/ or asked for more information](https://web.archive.org/web/20160604033907/https://twitter.com/maradydd/status/738801590333624320), both about the rape allegations and the circumstances of Appelbaum stepping down. According to **Süddeutsche Zeitung**, a Munich daily newspaper, the Berlin Public Prosecution Office is not aware of any claims to date against Appelbaum ("[Die Berliner Staatsanwaltschaft ermittelt nach eigenen Angaben bislang nicht gegen Jacob Appelbaum](https://archive.is/5D41r#selection-2189.168-2189.267)").

On June 4th, Steele [released a longer public statement](https://archive.is/uOTpp) about the situation. Though it did confirm that the allegations led to Appelbaum stepping down, it did not reveal who or how many victims there allegedly are, only that the matter was being investigated with the help of "a legal firm that specializes in employment issues including sexual misconduct."

> Over the past several days, a number of people have made serious, public allegations of sexual mistreatment by former Tor Project employee Jacob Appelbaum. These types of allegations were not entirely new to everybody at Tor; they were consistent with rumors some of us had been hearing for some time. That said, the most recent allegations are much more serious and concrete than anything we had heard previously. We are deeply troubled by these accounts.

> We do not know exactly what happened here. We don't have all the facts, and we are undertaking several actions to determine them as best as possible. We're also not an investigatory body, and we are uncomfortable making judgments about people's private behaviors.

> That said, after we talked with some of the complainants, and after extensive internal deliberation and discussion, Jacob stepped down from his position as an employee of The Tor Project.

Appelbaum's last message, prior to these allegations going public, was a tweet on the day he supposedly left the Tor Project: "[Changing of the guards](https://web.archive.org/web/20160605180001/https://twitter.com/ioerror/status/736259103790632960)." He remained silent until June 6th, when he [issued a statement](https://archive.is/YZ2co) using [TwitLonger](https://archive.is/I7Zhd), both to say that the allegations against him where "entirely false" and the "vicious and spurious" way they were delivered has made him "prepared to use legal channels, if necessary, to defend my reputation from these libelous accusations."

![Appelbaum's statement on TwitLonger](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CkQaB9mXAAAEGCz.jpg)

An international film publicist, [Claudia Tomassini](https://archive.is/eHxMD), told **WIRED** that Appelbaum's "[legal team is working on an injunction against these monstrous and factually incorrect accusations](https://archive.is/pCaSd#selection-1511.239-1511.444)." According to **The Daily Dot** she "[walked back that statement](https://archive.is/QZIdh#selection-1039.170-1039.350)," instead [saying](https://archive.is/Qdima#selection-1115.0-1123.169) he “deserves as fair a hearing as anybody who comes forward with grievances against him.” She also clarified that Appelbaum was not her client; her involvement with him arose out of one of her [media publicity projects](https://archive.is/XbC4k), [Laura Poitras](https://archive.is/eyCfz)' [*Risk*](https://archive.is/BZUi0), a documentary film on the cypherpunk underground that [features Appelbaum](http://www.claudiatomassini.com/uploads/media/RISK_POITRAS_PRESSNOTES.pdf), which premiered on May 19th at the directors' fortnight of [*Festival de Cannes*](https://archive.is/Vuoij) ([Cannes International Film Festival](https://archive.is/4U3ZF)).

Farivar said he had a "[story forthcoming](https://archive.is/aGbcD)" on this event. He has since published two, the [first](https://web.archive.org/web/20160605131228/http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/06/tor-developer-jacob-appelbaum-quits-after-sexual-mistreatment-allegations/) summarizing the allegations and Tor's response, the [second](https://archive.is/v9tPj) on Appelbaum's response. A [screenshot of an email](https://archive.is/No8pV) sent to him indicates, like the blog post, that they're investigating the allegations.

![screenshot of Tor email](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CkGZAXPWgAEb45T.jpg)

`Note: Though surname & email address are blacked out, 'Kate' is likely Communications Director Kate Krauss.`

On July 13th, the Tor Project [announced](https://archive.is/IU6S7) that it would be [replacing all seven members on the board of directors](https://archive.is/L1iIh) "in keeping with its commitment to the best possible health of the organization." The statement was [written by the outgoing board](https://archive.is/vVYc0#selection-75.2-75.56) and [posted as a press release](https://archive.is/vVYc0#selection-75.57-75.133) by [Krauss](https://archive.is/yxqlC#selection-471.0-471.57). Though Dingledine and Mathewson stepped down from the board, they will "[continue in their roles as co-founders of the Tor Project, leading Tor's technical research and development](https://archive.is/L1iIh#selection-143.0-143.404)."

> [In an interview, Ms. Steele said the board moves were intended to “bring in a strong, leadership-oriented board with more experience leading a strong and sustainable organization.” Recruiting new members, she said, had not been a challenge.](https://archive.is/XsOmO#selection-2115.0-2115.240)

> [“All of them had been watching what was going on with Tor and were committed and enthusiastic about growing this into a stronger and sustainable organization,” she said.](https://archive.is/XsOmO#selection-2119.0-2119.169)

> [The departing directors are Meredith Hoban Dunn, Ian Goldberg, Julius Mittenzwei, Rabbi Rob Thomas, Wendy Seltzer and two of Tor’s co-founders, Roger Dingledine and Nick Mathewson. Mr. Dingledine and Mr. Mathewson will remain as leaders of Tor’s technical research and development.](https://archive.is/XsOmO#selection-2123.0-2123.281)

Only six of the seven positions have been filled so far and it wasn't stated what positions the new directors will take.

### The Website and Twitter Accounts

The website [jacobappelbaum.net](https://archive.is/8m4Yk) was created as a victim story bulletin board, with an attached [GitHub repository](https://archive.is/https://github.com/ioerrror/jacobappelbaum.net*) run by [an account created on May 26th](https://archive.is/c6sgC) that uses his name and Twitter/ GitHub handle (with the only difference being an extra 'r', this is a form of [cybersquatting](https://archive.is/HTDwb)). Contrary to some suspicions that he had been hacked, his official website is listed on his Twitter profile as [appelbaum.net](https://archive.is/bPSlT#selection-1045.1-1045.15). According to the [registration](https://archive.is/VMYhK) [information](https://archive.is/nMT7M#selection-1219.0-1219.29), the website was created using [**PrivacyProtect**](http://privacyprotect.org/about-privacyprotection/) on May 27th, two days after Appelbaum reportedly stepped down and the same day that [the resignation agreement from Steele is dated](https://web.archive.org/web/20160608122942/https://cryptome.org/2016/06/tor-appelbaum-separation.pdf). The domain is being [hosted by **GitHub** in San Francisco](https://archive.is/aA6HV) using [GitHub Pages](https://archive.is/W5UtY). The OpenPGP key given as a contact method is named "[Jacob Appelbaum's Victims Collective](https://archive.is/FPrQm)."

![site registration](https://crypto.quebec/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Capture.png)

Three Twitter accounts were created in response to Appelbaum's resignation. The first, previously going by the handle "[@TimetoDieJake](https://archive.is/ucuwA)," has been changed to "[@VictimsOfJake](https://archive.is/tHhxh)" and is promoting the victim website (you can tell it's the same account because all the tweets match prior to the former's deletion). The [profile picture](https://archive.is/e9X6Y) for both is a [psychosurrealist](https://archive.is/tdi4a#selection-281.288-281.418) piece called "[Castrate Cure](https://archive.is/dR6X7)," portraying a small female figure using a guillotine to perform a [penectomy](http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/penectomy) on a giant man. No one has publicly claimed the site or the Twitter account, but Shepard has speculated that Appelbaum is smearing himself "[for sympathy](https://archive.is/VdYGT#selection-3903.7-3903.70)." On June 7th [an FAQ was added to the site](https://archive.is/avZNp#selection-1075.1-1075.254), in which it denied any association with the Twitter accounts:

> We have seen the accounts you're talking about and they aren't associated with us. We don't know who is running them, and some of us are disturbed by their incendiary statements and graphics. We don't condone calls for violence or for Jake to self-harm.

However, based on its [first tweet](https://archive.is/8R8Ax), the account had a suspiciously early awareness of the site and also has knowledge of [Patterson](https://archive.is/mhDRh) [blaming Appelbaum for Len Sassaman's suicide](https://archive.is/fP0A9). It is [unlikely](https://archive.is/W83f6) that they are a native German. They linked to [the site in its early stages](https://web.archive.org/web/20160603224422/https://ioerrror.github.io/jacobappelbaum.net/) (using [a link that is no longer live](https://archive.is/W5UtY)), where it very explicitly claimed to be Appelbaum.

![first version of website](https://contraspin.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/jan.png)

Under the 'Victims' header it went into what at first seemed to be random speeches, though it appears to be filler text used in a few other places (see [this blog site ](https://archive.is/1c355) or the 'Manifest' section of [this site](https://archive.is/7E2T4#selection-211.0-211.12) which has an identical webpage format).

Shepard is the widely suspected creator of the site. She tweeted that it was not her "[choice to keep the sources this vague, but frankly, people are afraid of retaliation](https://archive.is/V0hZw#selection-3557.1-3557.98)." (I'm assuming she means retaliation from people other than Appelbaum, as the level of detail in the stories would enable him to figure out from memory who was saying what and thus defeat the attempt at anonymity). She [told **WIRED**](https://archive.is/pCaSd#selection-1517.163-1517.350) that the creator was a "longtime member of the Tor community” whom she knows and trusts. Another [likely candidate](https://archive.is/Xd2qF#selection-4323.6-4323.19) is Lovecruft (see '[Allegations](https://github.com/Enegnei/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor/blob/master/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor.md#the-allegations)'). [Alison Macrina](https://archive.is/Q2TTK#selection-575.0-575.24), a Tor advocate, believes the Twitter account is a "[troll](https://web.archive.org/web/20160605165004/https://twitter.com/flexlibris/status/739146421023084544)" and "should be reported. [T]hey do not represent any of the victims I've talked to." (The Twitter account [responded](https://archive.is/1QraI) by calling her a "social manipulator," yet later [appears to support her](https://archive.is/WtUjz#selection-215.1762-215.2116).) She told **The Daily Dot** that the [website is authentic](https://archive.is/QZIdh#selection-1011.0-1019.230) and she, like Shepard and an unnamed Tor employee, knows who is behind it. It is entirely possible that all three could be directly involved with the website's creation and updates, due to their open admissions of having knowledge of the allegations for at least a few months.

Besides the alleged victims' stories themselves, the most alarming aspect of the website was the lack of good faith displayed by the tweet button at the bottom which prompted people to share the website as if it was owned and controlled by Appelbaum:

> I just read on [@ioerror](https://twitter.com/ioerror)'s homepage https://ioerrror.github.io/jacobappelbaum.net that he has sexually assaulted many people in #tech. #wtf

The site's FAQ now claims that they are "[a small group of people of different genders](https://archive.is/avZNp#selection-865.22-865.66)" who "[never meant to impersonate Jake or to trick anyone](https://archive.is/avZNp#selection-1189.110-1189.273). With the official text, we have tried to make it clear that it isn't pretending to be made by Jake himself." However they are still linking to his [real GitHub account](https://web.archive.org/web/20160608011441/https://github.com/ioerror) at the bottom of the page and their contact email is **ioerror@riseup.net**. The new tweet prompt text is:

> I just read on https://jacobappelbaum.net that [@ioerror](https://twitter.com/ioerror) has sexually assaulted many people in #tech.

The [last part of the FAQ](https://archive.is/avZNp#selection-1249.153-1249.432) states: "We do not believe that Jake is likely to ever face criminal charges. We know that some people will say that proves that the stories here aren't true. But we know that many people understand we are telling the truth, and we believe people will be safer because we made this site."

The second Twitter account, "[@Ioerror_info](https://archive.is/cFDr1)," was made several days later. On June 9th, its first tweet was an alternative version of a story published by **Gizmodo** and **The Daily Dot** (see under '[Allegations](https://github.com/Enegnei/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor/blob/master/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor.md#the-allegations)'). Like the first Twitter account, it is unknown who is behind it.

The third Twitter account, "[@JakeTheRaper](https://archive.is/Xfipv)," was made on June 14th. It mutually followed [an account](https://archive.is/ToNmk) which has been amplifying anti-Appelbaum tweets, especially those with a [mock-solidarity button](https://archive.is/qFfnZ) which [Shepard also liked](https://archive.is/gUCRQ). It linked to a [GitHub repository](https://archive.is/9x9qC) that was created on [June 12th](https://archive.is/3PK07), run by [Caleb James DeLisle](https://archive.is/V715e) ([@cjdelisle](https://archive.is/TzJIL)), the [lead developer of **cjdns**](https://archive.is/P37aF) and [project admin](https://archive.is/lvtgI#selection-1645.0-1645.19) for [**XWiki**](https://archive.is/Bgsjv#selection-303.1-321.1), who told me that he [does not support the message of that account](https://archive.is/ZVKLz) and has [added a disclaimer](https://archive.is/qUtfY#selection-821.0-821.445) (as did I when it decided to [link here](https://archive.is/bccqo#selection-1031.1-1031.27) instead, as the account violates my anti-harassment policy).

During the night of June 25th, [@VictimsOfJake](https://archive.is/40kys) tweeted a link to [an encrypted pastebin](https://archive.is/OIK0V) on [0bin.net](https://archive.is/Zf4Mp), which was set to expire within a day. The author claims to be someone in the security community who works on Tor, and they outline a list of nine points they consider important to "[the campaign to destroy Jake](https://archive.is/OIK0V#selection-215.121-215.149)." Among other allegations of complicated sexual relationships among various complainants and Appelbaum, it also accuses Nick Farr (see under '[Allegations](https://github.com/Enegnei/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor/blob/master/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor.md#the-allegations)') of being a "[paid hacking consultant for the CIA](https://archive.is/OIK0V#selection-215.2720-215.2777)" (Farr has since asserted that [family history and alcoholism](https://archive.is/SZsqc#selection-3993.1-3993.116) disqualified him from intelligence work, but that [he's worked for the Departments of Treasury and Labor](https://archive.is/LVlJL#selection-3977.1-3977.86)). About three hours later, a very new Reddit account called [Tor-Internal](https://archive.is/JmkxL) shared that link after [posting a second pastebin](https://archive.is/Grlpq), supposedly a [leaked chat log](https://archive.is/4FMxm) of the Tor-internal "[watercooler](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-517.19-523.27)" IRC channel from the 10th of November 2014. The pastebin itself is dated August 29th, 2015 (i.e. it has been public for ten months prior to it going viral). The preface oddly [requests that it not be leaked](https://archive.is/6NcTI); this could indicate, if the log file is legitimate, that it was originally shared with more than one person who decided to leak it, or that the logger themselves leaked it directly and betted on the file not being widely discovered. **Cryptome**, who was [tipped](https://archive.is/FCTmY#selection-4659.1-4659.62) by the [Cypherpunks Mailing List](https://archive.is/xhBhq), became [the second person](https://archive.is/Yn2j7#selection-31375.0-31403.6) to [share the pastebin file on Twitter](https://archive.is/BvqIx) and provided [a list of the pseudonyms used in the chat matched to core Tor Project names](https://archive.is/Zq9PX).

![David Chasteen](https://archive.li/hO8P6/99746b26c47950c0eac3904b925b896a49a9d846.jpg)

The subject of chat log involves confronting a recently-hired [project manager](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-5173.0-5227.43), [Iraq War](https://archive.is/RrSup) [veteran](https://archive.is/rAePv) [David Chasteen](https://archive.is/dmYpC) ("DaveC1"), who prior to signing on to the [six-month contract](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-5173.0-5173.104) had not divulged to Tor that [he had worked for the CIA](https://archive.is/0mis7#selection-607.483-607.806) under a [TSI/SCI](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-1705.0-1777.25) (Top Secret/ Sensitive Compartmented Information, [the highest tier of three](https://web.archive.org/web/20160530023722/https://www.clearancejobs.com/security_clearance_faq.pdf)) security clearance. According to this, he only said [he worked for the State Department](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-1339.0-1363.58). He [would not divulge what surveillance programs he was involved with](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-2593.0-2599.50), but in the past he has [indicated](https://archive.is/QNeXm#selection-3691.60-3691.120) that he [had experience](https://archive.is/nJcrz#selection-4665.1-4665.107) [in terrorism intelligence analysis](https://archive.is/u1Pwq#selection-3893.1-3893.135). 

Chasteen frequently proposed that he was going to formally out himself [through a **Boing Boing** article](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-1537.1-1537.107) [written by](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-1537.0-1663.37) [founder](https://archive.is/kvJvq#selection-123.60-137.11) [Xeni Jardin](https://archive.is/jXOiU), which received a [negative reaction](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-829.0-865.107) as those in Tor [urged him to work directly with them](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-931.0-967.143) and [wondered how to frame the story](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-1075.0-1129.75) [to the public](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-3871.0-3901.154). There is no evidence of such a story being published by **Boing Boing** and Jardin has yet to publicly comment on whether she worked with him, though it is [clear](https://archive.is/uTlIN) [they are known](https://archive.is/mHXl7) [to each other](https://archive.is/WvhO0). Appelbaum stated that Chasteen had [threatened to sue the Tor Project for discrimination against veterans](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-2113.0-2113.255) when questions about his prior work first arose; Chasteen apologized and said he was "[probably more sensitive to it than most](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-2179.0-2179.215)" due to [starting](https://archive.is/0duRs) "an organization that is focused on combatting veteran stereotypes and discrimination" (alluding to [**IAVA**](https://archive.is/A9Q7I), [Iraq & Afghanistan Veterans of America](https://archive.is/Xrqh4)). However shortly after that he rudely told [Nima Fatemi](https://archive.is/yxqlC#selection-247.0-247.21) ("[mrphs](https://archive.is/PhNou)"), an Iranian exile who was [worried about the impact of this on his family](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-2305.0-2305.188), to "[check his entitlement](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-2623.0-2623.202)." It was later revealed that [Dingledine ("sekritarma") had been physically sitting with Chasteen during the chat](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-4225.0-4249.54).

![Dingledine talks about Operation Onymous](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CmB7WpdXEAEpcOi.jpg)

Chasteen joined Twitter on [November 7th, 2014](https://archive.is/dmYpC#selection-1065.0-1065.20), [one day after he allegedly left the CIA](https://web.archive.org/web/20160629142311/https://cryptome.org/2016/06/david-chasteen-tor-timeline.pdf) according to [a timeline anonymously sent to **Cryptome**](https://archive.is/GaB6B) (which is yet to be verified). The timeline indicates that Chasteen had shown an interest in joining the Tor Project as early as January 2011; without explanation as to its relation to Chasteen (though it [appears to have been alluded to in the chat](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-1957.0-2059.142)), it also notes Operation Onymous (the [takedown of several dark web marketplaces on November 5th & 6th](https://archive.is/ANanG) by Europol, FBI, and DHS, followed by [the arrests of seventeen people](https://archive.is/7YTsu)) as a relevant event. His [only tweet for that year](https://archive.is/gSQB5) was on [December 12th](https://archive.is/VyD28) (which he [tweeted again almost a year later](https://archive.is/NfOwo#selection-3157.49-3157.92) with small changes in wording).

![Reilly's "previous work experience"](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CmPees8UMAAcjuB.jpg)

It is unclear whether [Reilly's](https://archive.is/N3u2k#selection-213.0-213.169) [("puffin") involvement](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-3325.0-3571.90) in [keeping the secret](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-4531.0-4591.125) influenced her resignation four months later after the Valencia meeting and to what extent [Wikileaks was informed](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-4225.0-4249.54) [about Chasteen](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-4963.0-5107.92). It is also unclear whether [disclosing Chasteen's name would have legal consequences](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-3157.0-3211.70) for the leaker, as was [asserted by Appelbaum in the chat](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-5539.0-5581.90). The [Intelligence Identities Protection Act](https://web.archive.org/web/20160401011752/http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/intel/RS21636.pdf) is a federal law amendment to the National Security Act of 1947 which specifies that "criminal penalties for the intentional, unauthorized disclosure of information identifying a covert agent" only apply if the agent was in service within five years during or prior to the disclosure. If the [timeline](https://web.archive.org/web/20160629142311/https://cryptome.org/2016/06/david-chasteen-tor-timeline.pdf) is correct and he worked with the CIA for a total of eight years (from 2006 to 2014), then the leak would fall within that sensitive 5-year time period. However, considering that Chasteen includes [information about his CIA work on his bio page for **IAVA**](https://archive.is/0mis7#selection-607.614-607.805), and no additional classified information about his work was revealed in the chat, it is quite unlikely charges would be justified.

![Intelligence Identities Protection Act](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cl6zlTXUsAAHuYR.jpg)

[Tor developer](https://archive.is/yxqlC#selection-455.0-455.14) [George Kadianakis](https://archive.is/hCExi) ("asn") shared a [link](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-5509.0-5509.60) with [former](https://archive.is/qyMV7#selection-727.0-727.92) [Tor Browser bundle signer](https://archive.is/XNLgM#selection-129.0-129.139) [Erinn Clark](https://archive.is/aAY3H) ("helix") to a [**Riseup.net** etherpad](https://pad.riseup.net/p/87Mazw3Jsdfe_pm) [first saved on November 30th, 2015](https://pad.riseup.net/p/87Mazw3Jsdfe_pm/timeslider#0) (shown via the [timeslider](https://pad.riseup.net/p/87Mazw3Jsdfe_pm/timeslider#643)), which doesn't appear to have been edited further until [June 26th 2016](https://pad.riseup.net/p/87Mazw3Jsdfe_pm/timeslider#1); someone used the pad to allege that Lovecruft was an FBI informant between [14:36](https://pad.riseup.net/p/87Mazw3Jsdfe_pm/timeslider#11)-[14:49](https://pad.riseup.net/p/87Mazw3Jsdfe_pm/timeslider#626) on June 27th. Since anyone can edit anonymously and the date of the edit is so recent (within a day of the pastebins going viral), there is no reason to believe this etherpad document is authentic.

![Riseup etherpad](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cl_LChwWYAA28AC.jpg)

There has been limited speculation about who the leaker(s) is, though the [general opinion](https://archive.is/sR8oa#selection-6009.1-6009.120) so far is that it may be [Appelbaum](https://archive.is/pJOR4) due to his [insistence on publishing through Wikileaks](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-5437.0-5437.110) and [his accepted offer](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-5857.0-5941.32) to [log the chat](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-6421.0-6421.50) for the tor-internal@ mailing thread. However it could just as easily be several other people in the channel, including Chasteen himself (notice how he repeatedly says [the story will be leaked](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-3913.0-3913.80)) and it would be very easy for the leaker to indirectly imply Appelbaum had done it, whether through a selective leak or by editing the log after the fact. [Joseph Cox](https://archive.is/1dHZk) of [**Motherboard**](https://archive.is/6Bgjw) [claims](https://archive.is/5IQzy) they "[confirmed the legitmacy of the transcript](https://archive.is/NHubE#selection-1495.2-1495.61)" but offered no information as to how that was done. [**Electronic Frontier Foundation** director](https://archive.is/qorI8) [Jillian York](https://archive.is/R5kGM), who was [called](https://archive.is/Bmgc3) "[highly promiscuous](https://archive.is/OIK0V#selection-215.8241-215.8384)" in the [first pastebin](https://archive.is/qVD57), believes that leaker [could be a woman](https://archive.is/Xf9rC#selection-3963.1-3963.93) and [someone](https://archive.is/N2rB6) else [fed her the information](https://archive.is/6D6xR#selection-6757.10-6757.90).

The [@VictimsOfJake](https://archive.is/pXStd) account [shared another link](https://archive.is/SAH61) on the night of June 27th, which was a [pastebin of their response](https://archive.is/WtUjz) to the [first encrypted pastebin](https://archive.is/OIK0V), which they told **Cryptome** was "[bullshit](https://archive.is/cyx6Z#selection-3171.29-3171.46)." The response oddly begins with an [assumption about the author's age, sex, and drug inexperience](https://archive.is/WtUjz#selection-215.190-215.321) based on the "[style](https://archive.is/WtUjz#selection-215.203-215.208)" of the writing, even though basic textual analysis of vocabulary puts their own writing style at a lower grade-level quality than what they're criticising (they casually use words like "fishy," "shill," and include an emoji, which "[a young person](https://archive.is/WtUjz#selection-215.306-215.320)" is more prone to use).

### The Allegations

`Warning: Many of these stories haven't been verified or vouched for! They are here to document allegations.`

The website profiles eight separate claims from people who were "[harassed, plagiarized, humiliated, and abused — sexually, emotionally, and physically](https://archive.is/8m4Yk#selection-245.34-245.140)." Initially, half of them were marked as placeholders ([Alice](https://archive.is/NdMrJ#selection-647.0-649.0), [Briar](https://archive.is/ZivH4#selection-647.0-649.0), Pheonix, and Sam), but the stories for "Sam" and "Phoenix" have since been added, along with more stories than the original eight (Kiwi and Nick). All, except for Nick's, are purposely under vague (i.e. anonymized) names. The GitHub copies of the entries are PNG images, the text of which is colored blue in odd places. Initially, all the entries were marked with the same date of December 31st, 2015; since then, newer entries have not only been given different dates but the dates on earlier entries were changed (you can [compare them in the archives](https://archive.is/https://github.com/ioerrror/jacobappelbaum.net*)). It is unclear what the date signifies. Synopses of what is alleged (ordered by their dates) on the website are as follows:

+ "[Phoenix](https://archive.is/hxfzw)," who at a post-workshop dinner was publicly propositioned for sex twice and subjected to other behavior she found humiliating ([January 26th, 2016](https://archive.is/jUxNM#selection-645.1-649.0)). [William Budington](https://archive.is/Hs1mS), a software engineer for the **Electronic Frontier Foundation**, has [personally vouched](https://archive.is/eRXca) for this story's authenticity; Micah Lee from [**The Intercept**](https://archive.is/Fydks) also [appears](https://archive.is/s32Fe) to have done so, as well as [Garrett Robinson](https://archive.is/kPNtX), [lead developer of **SecureDrop**](https://archive.is/rtrtU#selection-979.271-991.58), and [Runa Sandvik](https://archive.is/reM4m), [director of information security for **The New York Times**](https://archive.is/lReKa). 

> Based on the details provided, this incident likely occurred around the Berlin [Speakeasy](https://archive.is/X5dsZ) organized by [the **Electronic Frontier Foundation** (EFF) and the **Freedom of the Press Foundation** (FPF)](https://archive.is/gSS8z) on July 13th, 2014. Budington was indeed [in Berlin](https://archive.is/xKMXM) as an attendee, along with [Lee](https://archive.is/x6Hqt), [Sandvik](https://archive.is/q3B1D) (who [joined FPF](https://archive.is/r00mR) a [month before](https://archive.is/vI551#selection-361.335-361.344)), [Robinson](https://archive.is/1HRbv) and [Yan Zhu](https://archive.is/TOzVd) who [hosted a get-together the day prior](https://archive.is/yL13e). She [left before the incident occurred](https://archive.is/3WsXN) but has said she [heard rumours of harassment for years](https://archive.is/kAd37#selection-333.3-333.354). Considering it was a "workshop on whistleblowing platforms," it was probably the [**GlobaLeaks**](https://archive.is/NwR7M#selection-3187.5-3187.56)/ [**SecureDrop**](https://archive.is/bSGV8)/ [**Aspiration Tech** event](https://archive.is/yDOFI) occuring sometime between the [12th and 16th of July](https://archive.is/5dhs5), the topic of which may be similar to what Budington and [Zhu](https://archive.is/6TvDr) [presented](https://web.archive.org/web/20160612192330/https://freedom.press/securedrop-files/HOPEX.pdf) at [**HopeX**](https://archive.is/7QwGZ) in [New York City, July 18-20th](https://archive.is/O9zlW#selection-425.0-425.41). Appelbaum was still in [Berlin](https://archive.is/tLuiW) on the 15th and left for [Amsterdam](https://archive.is/uyBDC#selection-3961.0-3971.24) by the 16th, so it would've had to occur before then.

+ "[West](https://archive.is/TjhUQ)," who was kissed without consent by Appelbaum at a hacker event ([January 27th, 2016](https://archive.is/pEl8w#selection-647.0-649.0)).
+ "[Kiwi](https://archive.is/N10bK)," who initially "joined the digital rights community because of him," was then shamed by Appelbaum in public during the process of building their professional career ([January 28th, 2016](https://archive.is/XYS57#selection-647.0-649.0)).
+ "[Daniel](https://archive.is/R6nDq)," who was dating someone in the Tor community, says Appelbaum violated their privacy and propositioned them for sex ([January 31st, 2016](https://archive.is/hVV6V#selection-645.1-649.0)).
+ "[Forest](https://archive.is/bUw87)," who was propositioned for sex and sexually assaulted while she was sleeping ([February 1st, 2016](https://archive.is/1x40b#selection-647.0-649.0)).
+ "[River](https://archive.is/0jbVl)," romantically involved with him at the time of the incident, was propositioned for group sex and, while intoxicated, sexually assaulted by Appelbaum and subjected to unwanted sexual advances by at least one of his friends at a party ([February 2nd, 2016](https://archive.is/tsKaK#selection-647.0-649.0)). Lovecruft, who later came forward herself and [claims she's spoken with "River](https://archive.is/4lywH#selection-217.227-221.47)," clarified that there was [penetrative intercourse](https://archive.is/4lywH#selection-437.17-437.40) from both men which would justify at least two counts of rape, along with the other factors of [instructing a third party to rape](https://archive.is/4lywH#selection-429.0-429.44) an [unconcious victim](https://archive.is/4lywH#selection-445.0-445.98).
+ "[Sam](https://archive.is/Tn1fy)," who had a "minor romantic interest" in Appelbaum and was persuaded while intoxicated to get in a bathtub with him at his apartment, followed by verbal abuse when they resisted ([February 3rd, 2016](https://archive.is/EmkCL#selection-645.1-649.0)).
 
There are also complaints about [his name frequently being first on the list of authors](https://archive.is/5Aebu#selection-835.118-835.167) for academic papers; however [the practice of listing authorship alphabetically in research](https://web.archive.org/web/20160314150541/http://www.ams.org/profession/leaders/culture/CultureStatement04.pdf) (at least in the U.S.), especially in the fields of math and computer science, is very common:

> For this reason, mathematicians traditionally list authors on joint papers in alphabetical order. An analysis of journal articles with at least one U.S. based author shows that nearly half were jointly authored. Of these, more than 75% listed the authors in alphabetical order. In pure mathematics, nearly all joint papers (over 90%) list authors alphabetically. 

> These traditions differ from other areas of scholarship, especially those that frequently involve large numbers of researchers working on a single research project. In areas of mathematics that are more closely associated to such areas, the culture and traditions may blend together. 

> While these traditions are well-known to mathematicians, they are often misunderstood by other scholars whose traditions differ. Occasionally, this works against young mathematicians — especially those with names near the end of the alphabet.

Only five people claiming to be victims of Appelbaum have publicly come forward, outside of the allegations of plagiarism by Patterson and Norton. The [first](https://archive.is/bFXW2) was [Nick Farr](https://archive.is/9kjWs), who is one of three to claim authorship of [a story](https://archive.is/vekwa) on the victims website. His entry is now dated [January 25th, 2016](https://archive.is/qBIJV#selection-647.0-649.0). He alleges a span of incidents of verbal harassment which occured during the [**Chaos Communication Congress** event in 2013 (30c3)](https://web.archive.org/web/20160411055714/https://events.ccc.de/congress/2013/wiki/Main_Page), where he was an organizer of the Lightning Talks; Norton [says](https://archive.is/thLMm) she witnessed it. After approving a proposal for a talk which was going to argue that Appelbaum was a US Intelligence Operative, he was chastised first via email and then in person multiple times by both Appelbaum and "important people in the CCC." 

> [Jake demanded all the records I had received from this person. Jake also had the CCC edit the 30c3 wiki database to eliminate any trace of the offending talk.](https://archive.is/bFXW2#selection-357.161-357.319)

Furthermore, he says [a note](https://archive.is/bFXW2#selection-373.84-373.139) was left every night on his hotel room pillow (though he does not know by whom):

> "Don't make us use extreme measures. Hand it all over." 

The second is Alison Macrina ([@flexlibris](https://twitter.com/flexlibris)), [founder and director the **Library Freedom Project**](https://archive.is/RZunq), who in a [Medium post](https://archive.is/cwU9y) claimed she submitted the "Sam" story, and that she is also [friends](https://archive.is/cwU9y#selection-323.0-323.37) with "River." She tweeted that she had her ["come to Jesus" moment](https://archive.is/dPnG4#selection-4463.21-4463.99) months ago and that she was "[ashamed it took me so long to figure out what was what](https://archive.is/yQRbF#selection-3645.0-3645.59)." Both she and Shepard were still on [friendly terms](https://archive.is/aGNgk) with him as late as [mid-February 2016](https://archive.is/r7jnL), even though the "Sam" story is dated February 3rd. Macrina may have [visited Appelbaum](https://archive.is/orMqQ) in Berlin sometime at the end of 2014 and was also [there](https://archive.is/RaYRk) as a [Tor Project](https://archive.is/x4z7o) [representative](https://archive.is/mSgA1) for the CIJ Symposium in [March](https://archive.is/muAFe). In between she was a fellow presenter with Appelbaum at the last "[State of the Onion](https://archive.is/6unKs)" talk for the **Chaos Communication Congress** in Hamburg, Germany. Her [partner](https://archive.is/kfA1X) Franklin Bynum ([@frabyn](https://twitter.com/frabyn)), a [criminal defense attorney](https://archive.is/Aonrp) who she '[met](https://archive.is/t8VJT)' in July 2015, [migrated his law firm out of Google Apps](https://archive.is/J5zYE) after [her encouragement](https://archive.is/mhRFb#selection-239.0-239.144) to do so. They [have been](https://archive.is/g1xsR) [together](https://archive.is/dTyqM) [since at least mid-February](https://archive.is/oVCGq), and he [wrote](https://archive.is/NxSJo) "[Decoding Appelbaum](https://archive.is/mQm04)" on June 6th, though neither [disclosed Macrina's involvement](https://archive.is/pL1vi) with the allegations at the time.

The third is Isis Agora Lovecruft ([@isislovecruft](https://twitter.com/isislovecruft)), another [core Tor developer](https://archive.is/yxqlC#selection-395.0-395.15), who [revealed herself](https://archive.is/mmt9h) in a [blog post](https://archive.is/4lywH) as "Forest" on the same day that Macrina claimed to be "Sam." However she ruminates [less about the incident itself](https://archive.is/4lywH#selection-225.73-225.342) and more about when she [tried to resolve the situation six months ago in Valencia](https://archive.is/4lywH#selection-183.0-183.8)...

> Instead, I had planned to gather people for a secret meeting in Valencia, somewhere calm, neutral, and away from events, like on the beach, invite Jake, and have everyone willing who has ever been sexually assaulted, humiliated, harassed, or felt their boundaries disrespected, by him to take turns telling a few sentences about what he did to them and how it made them feel. Then we would tell Jake that, as his friends, we thought this needed to stop, and that we’d either deliver a list of the stories to The Tor Project and other organisations, or make all the stories public, if he refused to hold himself accountable for his actions or his behaviour did not appear to improve. In planning this secret meeting, I tried to determine what would cause Jake to perpetually disrespect other people like this, and if there were any positive things we could do to help him.

... as well as how she wants to pursue "transformative justice" based on her experience dealing with [a different man who was accused of (and later confessed to) the rape of two women](https://archive.is/4lywH#selection-179.153-179.927).

> There are some differences between how Jake is behaving to how the other anarchist I mentioned above was behaving. The other anarchist was willing to engage in the defined process, respectful of his victims’ needs, and eventually sincerely apologetic for his actions.

> I cannot condone his actions; however, I cannot condone violence and threats against Jake. Full stop. That is not productive. If he is further harmed, we never see the end of the wretched [**abused-abuser cycle**](https://web.archive.org/web/20151115231730/http://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/24/science/sad-legacy-of-abuse-the-search-for-remedies.html?).

> [**People who behave as Jake does are sick**](https://web.archive.org/web/20121105192631/http://yas.sagepub.com/content/early/2010/01/07/0044118X09358313.abstract), and they [**need help**](https://web.archive.org/web/20151115231730/http://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/24/science/sad-legacy-of-abuse-the-search-for-remedies.html?). Often, it is because [**they were severely hurt**](https://archive.is/K7vLX) at some point. As the activist adage goes, “*We need to be gentle with one another, so that we can be dangerous together*.”

She has [no forgiveness](https://archive.is/OZjM5) for the women who, in her view, "[weaponized their femininity](https://archive.is/LCCRO)" to sign a letter of solidarity. She later [amended](https://archive.is/e4vKk#selection-3637.0-3637.115) that the next day by saying "pity is the primary response. Signers are probably shocked/ hurt right now, and I'm very sorry for them."

In November 2015, [the FBI allegedly attempted to contact her](https://archive.is/uxlFJ) several times ([leaving a card](https://archive.is/uxlFJ#selection-129.36-129.215) at her family's home, [calling her mother's personal cell phone number](https://archive.is/uxlFJ#selection-175.566-179.319), [telling her lawyer that she should call them](https://archive.is/uxlFJ#selection-207.0-217.112) to [give her "opinion" on some documents](https://archive.is/uxlFJ#selection-321.259-325.40), which was [later retracted via voicemail](https://archive.is/uxlFJ#selection-375.219-383.361)). They apparently contacted her again at the end of April 2016, [with the added threat of a subpoena](https://archive.is/uxlFJ#selection-435.0-443.26), though they claimed she was not the target of their unspecified investigation.

> The FBI has contacted my lawyer again. This time, they said, “She should meet with one of our agents in San Francisco to talk. Otherwise, are you the point of contact for serving a subpoena? She’s not the target of investigation, but, uh… we uh… need her to clear up her involvement or… uh… potential involvement in a matter.”

The fourth is [Leigh Honeywell](https://archive.is/Cm3R9), a computer and network security professional, who says [she was in an open relationship](https://archive.is/77Sx2) with Appelbaum during 2006-2007 and he "ignored my use of a [safeword](https://archive.is/xZy5n)."

> In that time we spent together, he violated boundaries I set as though they were a game, particularly at times when I was intoxicated. There were a number of times I felt afraid and violated during interactions with Jacob. Being involved with him was a steady stream of humiliations small and large as he mistreated me in front of others and over-shared about our intimate interactions with friends who were often also professional colleagues.

> For example, on several occasions in professional situations, he told other people that I was good at a particular sex act. On another occasion where my primary romantic partner at the time, [Paul Wouters](https://archive.is/yi79U), was also present, Jacob ignored my use of a safeword when his sexual behavior turned into violent behavior that violated my limits. Paul and I both had to repeatedly tell Jacob to stop, and the experience was profoundly upsetting.

On June 21st, [Honeywell](https://archive.is/uslBP), [Valerie Aurora](https://archive.is/3KfaP), and [Mary Gardiner](https://archive.is/5FjVu) published a list of recommendations for communities on [how to "prevent 'rock stars'"](https://archive.is/GAl9X). However there are [concerns](https://archive.is/Ciz5a#selection-3601.1-3650.1) that based on Aurora's [reaction to Kobeissi](https://archive.is/8pjdK#selection-7227.1-7227.92) and [others](https://archive.is/RhwaF#selection-4457.0-4506.1), she belongs to the same '[rock star](https://archive.is/qXNwS)' mentality she is supposedly condemning. On June 24th, [McGill University professor](https://archive.is/bGBJx) [Gabriella Coleman](https://archive.is/jmDj5) joined Lovecruft and Macrina in praising the Tor Project for how "[action was taken relatively swiftly by Shari Steele](https://archive.is/5GvrC#selection-357.96-357.147)." She has not diclosed whether she knew about her [upcoming appointment to the Tor Project board of directors](https://archive.is/L1iIh#selection-211.0-213.1014) at the time the blog post was written.

> [I have known Jacob for 10 + years and it was only when the woman came forward in the Tor project that I had ever heard these specific sexual assault accusations.](https://archive.is/5GvrC#selection-461.59-461.220)

The fifth is [Ásta Guðrún Helgadóttir](https://archive.is/sdT41), an Icelandic politician and [Pirate Party member](https://archive.is/sGSp6), who tweeted allegations of sexual misconduct:

> [For me what did it when he jumped naked in my and my exes bed and asked for a three some. With a hard on.](https://archive.is/3x87O) [Because jumping naked in other couples bed begging for a three some is... normal? Some etiquette I wasn't aware](https://archive.is/KgdS1) [of. It didn't feel nice. It didn't feel right. Beside groping and shit. That was worse somehow.](https://archive.is/fpAqc)

[Violet Blue](https://archive.is/AFFqX), a San Francisco Bay Area freelance journalist, said she's known Appelbaum since 2005 and resisted his sexual advances, as well as [physically intervened](https://archive.is/k3vJE#selection-8053.9-8053.130) when he harassed another girl at a party. She added that these experiences made her wary of "[hero worship in 'hacktivism' circles'](https://archive.is/k3vJE#selection-6669.17-6669.53)." On June 16th she [published](https://archive.is/rEJoc) a [Medium post](https://archive.is/XSMJy) with more detail on her history with Appelbaum and the incident with the girl, who she says was a friend of hers.

> Outside of Kink, in 2007, Jake had sexually targeted a female friend of mine. Her and I were going to a large tech party in December; I think it was a Wikimedia party, and Jimmy Wales was there. My friend was feeling hunted by Jake, and early in the party she said he was trying to isolate her, and told me she was scared. She is not a big or strong girl, nor is she loud, and he was trying to convince her to go into a stairwell with him. The convincing turned into trying to pull her away physically, grabbing at her hands. I locked my arm with hers, and put myself in between her and Jake. All while he was trying to reach around me, while he was telling me to let go. I said No, she’s not going with you. I insisted a bit louder, *No*. He was livid.

(Note: Appelbaum *has* previously [stated that he worked for **kink.com**](https://archive.is/ZguXt); in fact, the statement was made in relation to [his objection](https://archive.is/OeqHP) to [Blue's sex talk](https://archive.is/OwOek) [being pulled](https://archive.is/4a4WA) from the [**BSides San Francisco** conference](https://archive.is/0UHK2) in February 2013 [due to complaints from Aurora](https://archive.is/CvBUb) of the [**Ada Initiative**](https://archive.is/8oUnH), despite [Blue's](https://archive.is/SeUp9) clear history of [sex-positivism](https://archive.is/wdSmV#selection-735.59-735.77). However she [misidentifies Shepard as "Tor Project's director"](https://archive.is/XSMJy#selection-363.2-367.2) even though the **WIRED** interview she links to [clearly says Shepard is a core developer](https://archive.is/FsG0A#selection-1541.163-1541.659), not a director. [Executive Director Steele](https://archive.is/yxqlC#selection-747.0-747.32) has not declared who she believes or made any more public statements about the investigation beyond what was said in [Appelbaum's resignation announcement](https://archive.is/uOTpp), and neither has any of [Tor's seven other directors](https://archive.is/HxbPp). Furthermore there appears to be some confusion in her summarization of the timeline of events surrounding [the Valencia intervention](https://archive.is/XSMJy#selection-555.0-563.59); the incident with Reilly at the Tor dinner was at the beginning of [March 2015](https://archive.is/DrGwH), whereas Lovecruft said she began planning the intervention [six months ago](https://archive.is/4lywH#selection-185.0-185.68). Blue appears to be falsely conflating the two events.)

[Emerson Tan](https://archive.is/TEIUh), another computer and network security professional, came forward through an interview with both [**Gizmodo**](https://archive.is/K2tdt) and [**The Daily Dot**](https://archive.is/QZIdh). He says Patterson and Shepard were also "eyewitnesses" to the incident, which occurred in the middle of the night (no date specified other than "[it was the day we arrived at CCC"](https://archive.is/QZIdh#selection-1047.91-1047.123)) during the [2015 **Chaos Communication Congress** (32c3)](https://web.archive.org/web/20160607230238/https://events.ccc.de/congress/2015/wiki/Static:Main_Page) in Hamburg, Germany.

> "At about 2 or 3 a.m. in the morning I happen to be talking to [Patterson], [Shepard] and Jacob Appelbaum and a group of other people who have come out of the congress hall into the lobby of the Raddison Blu hotel in Hamburg,” Tan told Gizmodo. “Jake has his hands all over this girl, and she is very obviously not very happy. You know, she’s looking for her bag, they’re having a conversation and she’s looking for her bag she can’t find her bag and she appears to be really quite distressed and Appelbaum forcibly attempts to try and kiss her, grabs her arm and her backside and makes a move for her breasts.

> ... And the other males who we were with were basically just kind of joking amongst themselves and don’t really seem to see anything wrong with it, which is really quite distressing,” Tan said. “So I watched this for about two to three minutes and then I decide to go and do something and just mount a very very subtle intervention. Which is, I go over, I shake Jake’s hand I tell him what a great job he’s doing with the Tor project and the rest of it and that gives the girl roughly the 30 seconds she needs to find her bag without being in an undistracted fashion. She left, and I found her hiding out in the hotel bar later, after Jake had left. She was pretty composed but obviously upset."

In **The Daily Dot** interview he gives far more detail, including what the girl, who Patterson says was "[obviously a little bit inebriated](https://archive.is/QZIdh#selection-1059.80-1059.113)," did [after the incident](https://archive.is/QZIdh#selection-1087.0-1087.256).

> Tan said afterwards he spoke briefly with the woman. He asked if she wanted to file a police report, but she was unwilling. She left the hotel before any of the witnesses learned who she was. The incident was never reported to police or to the Tor Project.

Tan posted the story on his Facebook page, saying that even though he didn't know who the girl was he had submitted it to Steele as part of the investigaton. He also mentions seeing Appelbaum "[trying to take upskirt photos of women" and "making lewd comments and allegations of threesomes with various members of the privacy community](https://archive.is/K2tdt#selection-1379.28-1379.233)." Shephard added that once when Appelbaum was "good drunk" in a Berlin bar in July of 2013, he "[discussed how he would ‘use my ass’](https://archive.is/K2tdt#selection-1385.127-1385.162)."

![Tan's Facebook posts](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CkX8kzqXEAA5azs.jpg)

However, Tan's story has since been contested. On June 9th, the first alternative story released by [@Ioerror_info](https://archive.is/cFDr1) using [**TwitLonger**](https://archive.is/UX9Jk) claimed that Tan's interpretation of the incident, which occured on the night of December 26th, was wrong. The "girl," allegedly a woman named [Jill Bähring](https://archive.is/nZJGj), had not been subjected to unwanted sexual advances by Appelbaum, and in fact has been "[romantically involved](https://archive.is/UX9Jk#selection-445.1-445.96)" with him. (Her Twitter account was [initially private](https://archive.is/syKKA) but she made it public within a few hours of the statement being published to [authenticate that it was from her](https://archive.is/nZJGj#selection-3499.0-3499.110).) She admits to having temporarily lost her bag and being "[emotionally distressed](https://archive.is/UX9Jk#selection-457.41-457.63)" at the time, but that it was not because of Appelbaum.

> I did indeed look not very happy. I was emotionally distressed at that time and told Jake, one of my close confidants, about my situation. He did have his hands all over me, just as I had my hands all over him. At no point did Jake forcibly attempt to try and kiss me, nor did he grab me in any inappropriate manner.

> While we were talking, I realized that I didn’t have my bag with me, and started looking for it. Anyone who has ever lost sight of their wallet and phone will look “quite distressed” as a consequence. According to Tan and Patterson, none of our friends seemed to see anything wrong with that situation: “And the other males who we were with were basically just kind of joking amongst themselves and don’t really seem to see anything wrong with it, which is really quite distressing” 

> This is true. There was nothing wrong with it. I was among several friends with whom I felt absolutely safe.

She also says that Tan's account of how he approached them wasn't accurate.

> The next day, I wasn’t going to be at the conference, so I didn’t expect to see Jake for a couple of weeks. Jake and I said goodbye to each other in the hotel lobby, and we kissed. But since my friend was waiting for me to leave, I playfully pushed Jake away. At that time, I noticed Emerson Tan for the first time – since he was intervening at that point. He states: “So I watched this for about two to three minutes and then I decide to go and do something and just mount a very very subtle intervention. Which is, I go over, I shake Jake’s hand I tell him what a great job he’s doing with the Tor project and the rest of it and that gives the girl roughly the 30 seconds she needs to find her bag without being in an undistracted fashion.”

> I recall Tan approaching me, asking me if Jacob was harassing me. I said he wasn't. Nevertheless, Tan dragged me away and immediately started talking intensely to Jake. At that point I decided to leave, since my friend was waiting for me. I walked him to his hotel, which was only a couple of blocks away.

She ends the statement by questioning why "[a highly distorted version of my experience](https://archive.is/UX9Jk#selection-509.1-521.68)" had been published in the first place. [Pepijn Le Heux](https://archive.is/h6nay), a Dutch attorney and [Tor advocate](https://archive.is/Q2TTK#selection-507.0-507.24) based in Amsterdam, [retweeted the statement](https://archive.is/9VklJ#selection-1921.0-1921.95) saying "I was at Raddison Blu that night, I know these people & as far as I know this story is accurate." [Yan Zhu](https://archive.is/PTh3G), [senior software engineer for **Brave**](https://archive.is/W1l9v#selection-971.0-971.25), an [**Electronic Frontier Foundation** Technology Fellow](https://archive.is/Zi0C1), and [former admin at the Tor Project](https://archive.is/PTh3G#selection-1775.0-1775.11), tweeted that she "[was also around that night and didn't do anything because Jill seemed ok. Glad to hear that she was](https://archive.is/1ZMM7)."

**Gizmodo** subsequently [published a new story](https://archive.is/dPAfG) with Jill Bähring's account, though they have yet to add an update to [the original](https://archive.is/toIZA) despite at least [one request](https://archive.is/mxiMI) to do so; **The Daily Dot** both [added an update to their original story](https://archive.is/VBMmD#selection-1201.195-1213.57) and published [a new one](https://archive.is/Qdima) (though they have yet to correct the statement about [Bähring's story being published by Appelbaum](https://archive.is/vHxH2#selection-1255.0-1257.41)). Dell Cameron, one of three authors collaborating on coverage at **The Daily Dot**, tweeted [screenshots of emails](https://archive.is/HATig#selection-5799.1-5799.18) to show he was trying to contact Bähring through Tomassini, as she has so far not spoken directly to the press. Tan was also contacted to [comment](https://archive.is/Qdima#selection-987.0-987.146) on the fact that his story had been refuted and [denied approaching her to ask if she was being harassed](https://archive.is/wozbD#selection-7027.0-7027.42):

> “This is a situation open to misinterpretation because I do not know what she's thinking,” Tan said. “I'm fully willing to stand up and say that.”

Neither Patterson nor Shepard have revoked their statements, though they have briefly commented on the fact that Bähring refuted their story. In reply to someone pointing out that she had yet to make any retraction, Patterson said that "[there are some goddamn impatient people on the internet. Response forthcoming, but I have a life and a job](https://archive.is/oioum#selection-6789.1-6789.108)." Shepard now characterizes the story as "[a minor incident the press inflated](https://archive.is/sStV1#selection-5705.79-5705.114)" and says she was not a reliable judge of the situation.

> [Frankly, I can't read neurotypical human interactions well enough to reliably tell if someone's upset or not; I was relying entirely](https://archive.is/sStV1#selection-6053.1-6053.133) [on](https://archive.is/sStV1#selection-6467.4-6477.112) [@Emerson_T's](https://archive.is/nBDWm) [interpretation of events that night, and also had the least clear view of anyone involved, since I was trying](https://archive.is/sStV1#selection-6467.4-6477.112) [to avoid being spotted by him.](https://archive.is/sStV1#selection-6861.4-6861.34) [This argument over what did or did not actually happen that night, though, is entirely orthogonal to the actual allegations against](https://archive.is/sStV1#selection-7211.1-7211.132) [Jake which are the only reason the incident in question ever got any attention in the first place.](https://archive.is/sStV1#selection-7565.4-7565.102)

### The Public Reaction

As a [result](https://archive.is/q2zil) of the allegations, Appelbaum has been [removed](https://web.archive.org/web/20160606171748/http://w3.cultdeadcow.com/cms/team_bio.html) from the computer underground group [Cult of the Dead Cow (cDc)](https://web.archive.org/web/20160603052306/http://w3.cultdeadcow.com/cms/about.html), of which he has been [a member since July 2008](https://web.archive.org/web/20160312134611/http://w3.cultdeadcow.com/cms/team_bio.html). Their [official statement](https://archive.is/M1Kgd#selection-67.202-67.401) says that "as we have become aware of the anonymous accusations of sexual assault, as well as the stories told by individuals we know and trust, we've decided to remove Jake from the herd effective immediately." [Oxblood Ruffian](https://archive.is/GxVPv) (pseudonym), who has been a cDc member since April 1996, released their own individual statement on Appelbaum being removed from the group and how he "[used our name to advance his career and gain entrance to circles that might have been closed to him](https://archive.is/0fJev)" without actually contributing anything. He also says "[preying upon the vulnerable is an ungendered pathology](https://archive.is/0fJev#selection-381.355-381.410)" and defends the right of the victims to remain anonymous.

On June 8th, **Freedom of the Press Foundation**'s co-founder and executive director [Trevor Timm](https://archive.is/LRcD9) [announced](https://archive.is/JDoO8) that Appelbaum was also [removed](https://archive.is/Eyzzi) from his [position](https://archive.is/lUiZL#selection-401.0-401.15) on their volunteer technical advisory board.

> In light of the allegations that have been made, Jacob Appelbaum is no longer a member of our outside volunteer technical advisory board. We hope that the serious accusations made against him, and his denial of them, are resolved as fairly and as expeditiously as possible.

[Former](https://archive.is/YT5Mc#selection-381.0-381.15) [systems administrator](https://web.archive.org/web/20160328165000/https://freedom.press/about/staff/kevin-gallagher) [Kevin Gallagher](https://archive.is/87FaO) (who [announced](https://archive.is/XnqrV) he was [leaving **Freedom of the Press Foundation**](https://archive.is/ST3kN) on June 24th) said that their tech advisory board "[is not the most active thing. Jake had not even communicated with them in several years](https://archive.is/xFMNc)."

**Purism** quietly [removed](https://archive.is/6DS15) him after [a potential customer objected](https://archive.is/FV78W) to Appelbaum still being listed as their [security advisor](https://web.archive.org/web/20160604221755/https://puri.sm/about/).

On June 9th, the **Chaos Computer Club** (CCC) released a "[reminder](https://archive.is/tcgqB)" which did not directly mention Appelbaum or the allegations, but stated that anyone who violates the [ethical principles](https://archive.is/tcgqB#selection-185.0-195.92) of their "galatic organization" is "not welcome."

> In light of recent accusations against a regular visitor and speaker at our events, the Chaos Computer Club re-emphasizes the following: The CCC is, by its charter and by common consent, a galactic organization of all life forms. We are dedicated to providing a safe, comfortable, and supportive experience for everybody attending our events.

> ... [As stated previously](https://archive.is/7OwVs), we do not tolerate life forms who refuse to share this openness and respect towards others: Creatures that are not excellent to others are not welcome.

Upon the reminder's release it was not clear whether Appelbaum was henceforth not welcome or if they intended to investigate, or already had investigated, the reports of harassment at their events. On June 17th, they [clearly stated that Appelbaum is no longer welcome](https://archive.is/peoaA).

On June 10th, [**Noisebridge**](https://archive.is/ZQZjb), an educational hackerspace in San Francisco, released a PGP-signed [statement](https://archive.is/1Uv7E#selection-51.472-51.573) that Appelbaum was "no longer welcome in our community, either in its physical or online spaces." On June 21st, they [officially banned him](https://archive.is/bQDcq#selection-107.0-107.1266) through community consensus after it was proposed by [San Francisco Bay Area developer](https://hackerbots.net/~tdfischer/cv.pdf) [Torrie](https://archive.is/I6n8n) [Fischer](https://archive.is/5jlY9) ([@tdfischer_](https://archive.is/SSmIg#selection-9425.0-9453.3)). [Rubin Starset](https://archive.is/LOAdI), a founding member of **Noisebridge**, also [published](https://archive.is/gydhN) [a longer statement](https://archive.is/0JXDc) on how the community's inclusive culture had to be remedied to prevent such harassment and abuse in the future. Appelbaum [co-founded](https://archive.is/O7gQd#selection-2189.162-2193.1) [**Noisebridge**](https://archive.is/EPz1X) with security expert [Mitch Altman](https://archive.is/lIJMY) (Sassaman was also "[mildly involved](https://archive.is/7Z94w#selection-3163.27-3163.42)" despite being [out of the country](https://archive.is/OCNJk)) within the summer and [fall](https://archive.is/3dNbK) of 2007 as an extension of the **Chaos Computer Club**. He is still listed as a [user](https://archive.is/QVDgl) on their '[People](https://archive.is/7MsIa#selection-1213.0-1213.13)' page (though note it is not a membership list) and he is also the [domain owner](https://archive.is/6fMei#selection-773.17-773.32) of their website [noisebridge.net](https://archive.is/7JD6Y).

![Noisebridge ban](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Clh5V_7UgAAWbeW.jpg)

On June 11th, a group of women consisting of "friends, colleagues, co-workers or partners" of Appelbaum [released](https://archive.is/ochsL) a [statement](https://web.archive.org/web/20160611153425/https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2858953/Statement-Appelbaum-11-06.pdf) criticising the "coordinated and one-sided attack on his character and work."

> We are not apologists for any genuine wrongdoing, and as women working in this community we know that 
there are struggles around sexism. However, simple punitivism is not how the human rights that we all defend 
should be enforced or framed.

> We believe that an open and evidence-based discussion in this situation is necessary to allow our community to 
develop better processes to handle any allegations. Furiously targeting one person without allowing for proper 
fact analysis will never solve the bigger structural problem that has been highlighted. We should use this moment
to grow and make things better, not destroy the movement and create divisions. We need to create a channel for 
discussions on how to make things better. 

The initial twelve signatories of this statement are: [Renata Avila](https://archive.is/PNR07), [Human Rights Lawyer](https://web.archive.org/web/20160319080136/http://webfoundation.org/about/executive-team/renata-avila/); Susan Benn, Artist; [Cathleen Berger](https://archive.is/oEdah), Policy Advisor; [Geraldine de Bastion](https://archive.is/DftjZ), Policy Expert; Annegret Falter, Political Scientist; [Marie Gutbub](https://archive.is/EJlcF), Journalist; [Sarah Harrison](https://web.archive.org/web/20160316133415/https://wikileaks.org/Profile-Sarah-Harrison.html), Journalist; Christy Lange, [Writer](https://archive.is/EgmRA#selection-1777.0-1789.63); [Isik Mater](https://archive.is/QWygD), Infosec Specialist; [Angela Richter](https://archive.is/99Fk6), [Theatre Director](https://web.archive.org/web/20160611160912/http://cultureforum.eu/person/angela-richter/); [Felicity Ruby](https://felicityruby.com/), PhD Candidate; [Joana Veron](https://archive.is/gSgid), Lawyer.

They've also [created](https://archive.is/IidiH#selection-3361.0-3391.91) a [website](https://archive.is/KVN4s) with a copy of the statement, inviting others who agree with "[the spirit of this letter](https://archive.is/KVN4s#selection-115.126-115.151)," but may not be colleagues or personal friends of Appelbaum, to sign it by contacting this email: **dueprocess@riseup.net**. To date, there are forty-four additional signatures and only two people later requested to have their names removed: [Herzmut](https://archive.is/1pBih#selection-171.0-171.25) and [Bailey Lamon](https://archive.is/P2RGo#selection-175.0-175.69).

> We therefore invite all others to add their names to this list (using the below contact details) to show their agreement with the spirit of this letter - solidarity with Jake in how this is being handled, on the side of justice for all, and in belief of the need to develop a safe space for accessing the issues to enable building open and transparent guidelines to deal with sexism and gender issues within our infosec and digital rights communities.

They later added a [tweet prompt](https://archive.is/ymmJL):

> In Solidarity with Jacob Appelbaum [@ioerror](https://twitter.com/ioerror) and on the Side of Justice for All. We urge others to add their names to https://ourresponse.org/

Though [Shava Nerad](https://archive.is/3gW7r), [Tor Project's founding executive director](https://archive.is/Fa1wX#selection-1471.1-1471.57) who [left](https://archive.is/vzidN#selection-4891.1-4891.79) around the same time [that Appelbaum first joined](https://archive.is/BwxdB#selection-5425.1-5425.112), was [not one of the signatories](https://archive.is/8CJYx#selection-5281.1-5281.73), she expressed [a similar sentiment](https://archive.is/ae5EQ) [very early on](https://archive.is/crtyC) when the allegations were first being made, that she does not believe [shaming](https://archive.is/mghYZ#selection-4975.70-4975.77) him [so soon](https://archive.is/JeBHl#selection-5305.94-5305.123) is a "[sustainable holding pattern](https://archive.is/lwl2E#selection-4661.60-4661.87)."

On June 15th, **The Daily Dot** published [information](https://archive.is/NRQB4#selection-4629.0-4629.23) from [Tom Lowenthal](https://web.archive.org/web/20150326060100/http://tomlowenthal.com/), currently staff technologist for the [**Committee to Protect Journalists** (CPJ)](https://archive.is/Pr5hq#selection-6449.0-6449.18) and a track lead for journalism & media at the [**Internet Freedom Festival**](https://archive.is/6nauY#selection-3111.0-3111.31), which in 2016 was held [March 1-6th](https://archive.is/C1tid). Lowenthal says that the organizers of the **Internet Freedom Festival** were aware of the allegations prior to the event and "[decided in advance that Appelbaum would not be allowed at the conference or inside the venue and had a contingency plan in place in case he tried to participate](https://archive.is/emaP9#selection-1057.0-1057.389)." 

> [There's a major public vulnerability which is being exploited in the wild. You need to patch it.](https://archive.is/7TNb7#selection-3143.0-3143.96) [Appelbaum wasn't the problem, just a really bad symptom. Our communities are still vulnerable to the attack he used.](https://archive.is/7TNb7#selection-3661.0-3661.116)

It isn't clear how long [Lowenthal](https://archive.is/r3Bqn) has [personally had knowledge of the allegations](https://archive.is/coBSA#selection-291.47-307.212) about Appelbaum's behavior, or how the **Internet Freedom Festival** became aware of them more than three months prior to the announcement of Appelbaum's resigation from the Tor Project.

[Randi Lee Harper](https://archive.is/byGrf#selection-47425.0-47494.1), a [San Francisco Bay Area activist for online abuse prevention](https://archive.is/agPio), criticised the men who only now were coming forward to vouch for accounts of Appelbaum's behavior they had witnessed:

> [All these men are coming forward with stories of how they saw stuff. Good for you. Where the fuck were you? Why didn't you do something?](https://archive.is/HYub2#selection-3919.0-3919.136) [You will not get a "good lil ally" badge for coming forward to confirm stories now. You waited for women to take the risk. Cowards.](https://archive.is/HYub2#selection-4327.0-4327.131)

On June 18th, Appelbaum was [removed](https://archive.is/XHMBl) as a [developer at the **Debian Project**](https://archive.is/zQ281#selection-14885.0-14901.15). [Russell](https://archive.is/YGtex) [Coker](https://archive.is/BzFIy), a Melbourne-based [Debian developer](https://archive.is/zQ281#selection-14961.0-14977.13), has [written to the Linux Australia mailing list](https://archive.is/97YS4) requesting that Appelbaum be barred from attending the Australian National Linux Conference (LCA) and that the group release a public statement. On June 22nd [Hugh Blemings](https://archive.is/WPBVw), [president of Linux Australia](https://archive.is/qBOUy), released a [statement](https://archive.is/eAX8g) from himself and the council on the mailing list saying that they were aware of the recent allegations made but they [had not received any reports of misconduct during the 2012 conference](https://archive.is/eAX8g#selection-65.238-65.399) when [Appelbaum was a keynote speaker](https://archive.is/IU6jO). 

> As facts in this matter become clear Linux Australia will consider what, if any, action is appropriate in relation to Mr Appelbaum’s potential involvement in future Linux Australia activities.

On July 1st, Blemings released a [second statement officially banning Appelbaum](https://archive.is/YiEM5#selection-59.749-59.962) from Linux Australia events.

On July 16th, Tor directory authority operator '[Lucky Green](https://archive.is/sYloW)' announced that they would be shutting down their Dutch-based [bridge](https://archive.is/LhRoL) authority "[Tonga](https://archive.is/XwPVP)" as well as "[a number of fast Tor relays](https://archive.is/CYkMj#selection-427.40-427.67)." [Berlin-based writer](https://web.archive.org/web/20160227031505/https://events.ccc.de/congress/2015/Fahrplan/events/7134.html) [Bethany Horne](https://web.archive.org/web/20150825185040/https:/twitter.com/bbhorne) said this announcement has been "[demoralizing](https://web.archive.org/web/20160723081938/https:/twitter.com/bbhorne/status/756711893981663233)" with regards to the Tor community.

![Tonga DA shutting down](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CnlvOBSWYAEk8dN.jpg)

Once "[Tonga](https://archive.is/uU7Ft)" is removed there will be eight directory authorities, rather than the ten prior to Appelbaum's resignation. However as a bridge authority it will have to be replaced immediately and the process of removing it will "cause severe disruption for the bridge ecosystem," according to a [leaked](https://archive.is/yftsO) [email allegedly sent by Hahn](https://archive.is/nnEtT).

![Hahn email on dir/bridge auth](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CnpqIj6W8AQofhc.jpg)

[M.C. McGrath](https://archive.is/ke9Yv), founder of the [non-profit **Transparency Toolkit**](https://archive.is/PkZzu), shared a [picture](https://archive.is/apZ0h) of the side of a building which had been graffitied to say "*A rapist lives here | ein Vergewaltiger wohnt hier*!" with an arrow pointing to the middle window. This targeting is reminiscent of [1970s Manhattan feminists](https://books.google.com/books?id=kpNarH7t9CkC&pg=PA289&lpg=PA289&dq=%22a+rapist+lives+here%22&source=bl&ots=WoxzxaSDm5&sig=kINLSemfTubvNb5_7SkgoRpgfas&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiw55u0uMXNAhVFWRQKHVfFBeEQ6AEIKTAC#v=onepage&q=%22A%20Rapist%20Lives%20Here%22&f=true):

> **Lutz, Mary E.** (1949 - ) became a member of The Feminists (1972) in NYC, a group that wrote and published tracts against marriage, for man-hating, and for re-establishing matriarchy. Members also conducted actions and gave speeches advocating political education and direct action. "Once I gave a talk at Dartmouth College in which I shocked students by proclaiming women should consider aborting male fetuses, a remark for which I paid dearly," she says. In 1973, TF targeted Manhattan rapists by identifying their workplaces and homes, and stenciling "A Rapist Lives Here" in red paint on buildings and sidwalks.

McGrath [said](https://archive.is/YgtDs) this was Appelbaum's house in Berlin, Germany (where [he's lived since 2013](https://archive.is/skoYv#selection-1223.668-1223.844)), but the defacer(s) had [targeted the wrong apartment window](https://archive.is/giZem). He later posted [a second picture](https://archive.is/FDe1v) made in daylight. He reacted by saying "[this is not justice for anyone](https://archive.is/dOA5L#selection-2315.0-2315.34)" and how "the mob going after [@ioerror](https://twitter.com/ioerror) has done more to make me feel unsafe than people in the intelligence community threatening me about my work." The identity of the defacer(s) is unknown, but Shepard speculated that Appelbaum "[graffitied his own apartment for sympathy](https://archive.is/VdYGT#selection-3903.101-4020.1)."

![defaced building](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ckm-FkAWgAAJzEc.jpg)

Though he also did not directly mention Applebaum by name or the allegations, [Daniel J. Bernstein](https://web.archive.org/web/20160607185552/https://twitter.com/hashbreaker), professor of mathematics and computer science at the [**Eindhoven University of Technology**](https://archive.is/7muWD#selection-18219.1-18219.26) where Appelbaum is currently studying, published [a blog post](https://archive.is/NPmvQ) warning of the consequences of skirting due process.

>  Is it really so hard to recognize both of these directions of error? If I prejudge and punish alleged culprits who have not had their day in court, then I will inevitably punish some innocent people: the unfortunate reality is that **many accusations of crimes are false**. If I prejudge and punish accusers who have not had their day in court, then I will inevitably punish some innocent people: the unfortunate reality is that **many accusations of crimes are true**.

> When I say "day in court", what I really mean is **due process**. Due process is a set of ethical principles that civilization has painstakingly developed over several centuries, recognizing that punishment is corrupted by many sources of error on both sides: communication is poor; memories are faulty; sometimes people don't tell the whole truth; sometimes people tell something other than the truth.

> ...  It's really not that hard to stay calm and say something like this: "We weren't there. At this point we can't be sure what happened. Sometimes accusations are true, and sometimes they aren't. It's important for a neutral judge to hear testimony from the accuser and from the accused."

> But not everyone stays calm. Angry people continue to join these mobs. They blog and tweet and report their ill-informed speculations in favor of the accuser or the accused, confident in their own righteousness and blithely unaware of the possibility of being wrong. Ultimately the accused and the accuser are both punished, truth be damned.
