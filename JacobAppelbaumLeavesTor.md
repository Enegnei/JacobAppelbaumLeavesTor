### The Resignation

On June 2nd, 2016, Tor Project [Executive Director Shari Steele](https://archive.is/Q2TTK#selection-767.0-767.32) posted a ["transition" update](https://web.archive.org/web/20160603213021/https://blog.torproject.org/blog/jacob-appelbaum-leaves-tor-project) on the organization's blog:

> Long time digital advocate, security researcher, and developer Jacob Appelbaum stepped down from his position at The Tor Project on May 25, 2016.

A few days later, his name was [removed from the list](https://archive.is/yxqlC) of core Tor Project employees and volunteers.

[Jacob Appelbaum](https://archive.is/GItar) officially [joined the Tor Project in 2008](https://web.archive.org/web/20150926185057/https://blog.torproject.org/blog/jacob-and-matt-join-tor-project) as part of the translation team, improving documentation for non-technical users, and advocacy for the Tor network in general. He also runs one of Tor's [directory authorities](https://archive.is/7jFmj#selection-4563.0-4569.364), a special server which maintains a list of all verified exit nodes and helps Tor clients find relays in the network (there were 8 of these in 2012; there are now 10).

On the 24th of May, one day before Appelbaum allegedly stepped down, [core Tor developer](https://archive.is/Q2TTK#selection-739.0-739.25) [Andrea Shepard](https://archive.is/ol0mQ) tweeted a [commitment hash](https://web.archive.org/web/20160603213504/https://twitter.com/puellavulnerata/status/735230102154448898) (i.e. [making a statement of secret value which can be authentically revealed in the future](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Commitment_scheme)). Within the same day that Steele announced Appelbaum's departure, Shepard [revealed the hash](https://archive.is/V0hZw#selection-26133.0-26133.78):

> [@puellavulnerata](https://archive.is/V0hZw): Precommitment revealed: sha256("It seems one rapist is one rapist too many\n")

(To verify this yourself using OpenSSL, type `echo It seems one rapist is one rapist too many | openssl sha256`, the output of which should be `(stdin)= bfb9a7c833a5fc8f5a938d816b1bbc4acaa06519fdb1af4c8632719596807dac`).

On May 27th, Steele reportedly [requested that Appelbaum sign a resignation agreement](https://web.archive.org/web/20160608122942/https://cryptome.org/2016/06/tor-appelbaum-separation.pdf) in which he would promise "[mutual non-disparagement](https://archive.is/FP1GE)," including giving up the right to sue the Tor Project. According to the attached explanation by John Young (aka **Cryptome.org**), Appelbaum refused to sign the agreement.

As people responded to the news about Appelbaum as well as these mysterious tweets, it became clear that they were connected after technology researcher and writer [Meredith Patterson](https://web.archive.org/web/20160325052441/http://www.thesmartpolitenerd.com/aboutme.html) ([@maradydd](https://archive.is/1FYbO)) tweeted about [the lack of explanation in Steele's announcement](https://archive.is/1FYbO#selection-5199.0-5213.107).

> [blog.torproject.org/blog/jacob-appelbaum-leaves-tor-project](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/jacob-appelbaum-leaves-tor-project) is a gross disservice to the Tor community. People deserve to know why Tor evicted its resident sociopath. You don't just kick sociopaths down the road and play like you've done the necessary. That's extending their social license to operate. Tor had the chance to nip this in the bud back when Jake was just a plagiarist. They ignored it, and he graduated to sexual assault... Jake finally raped enough people that Tor as an organisation couldn't ignore it anymore.

As background to her assertion that he "graduated [from plagiarist] to sexual assault," it would be relevant to note that Patterson and Appelbaum have a history of being involved in [plagiarism disputes](https://web.archive.org/web/20160605152831/http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.otr.devel/1546), where Appelbaum was the accused, extending back prior to the passing of Len Sassaman (her husband), mentioned in [this thread](https://twitter.com/ioerror/status/302261054497509376) as "Len," in 2011. She recently [tweeted her account](https://archive.is/xuuCG) of an interaction with Appelbaum which followed that particular dispute, and [then said](https://archive.is/laWvR) that "Jake hasn't apologised to any of his assault/harassment victims that I know of either. And to everyone else trying to make hay out of that distinction, hairsplitting isn't a good look on you." American journalist [Quinn Norton](https://archive.is/GIttq) also joined her in [claiming involvement in plagiarism disputes](https://archive.is/5Sywt) with Appelbuam.

The majority of those who responded were [shocked and/ or asked for more information](https://web.archive.org/web/20160604033907/https://twitter.com/maradydd/status/738801590333624320), both about the rape allegations and the circumstances of Appelbaum stepping down.

On June 4th, Steele [released a longer public statement](https://archive.is/uOTpp) about the situation. Though it did confirm that the allegations led to Appelbaum stepping down, it did not reveal who or how many victims there allegedly are, only that the matter was being investigated with the help of "a legal firm that specializes in employment issues including sexual misconduct."

> Over the past several days, a number of people have made serious, public allegations of sexual mistreatment by former Tor Project employee Jacob Appelbaum. These types of allegations were not entirely new to everybody at Tor; they were consistent with rumors some of us had been hearing for some time. That said, the most recent allegations are much more serious and concrete than anything we had heard previously. We are deeply troubled by these accounts.

> We do not know exactly what happened here. We don't have all the facts, and we are undertaking several actions to determine them as best as possible. We're also not an investigatory body, and we are uncomfortable making judgments about people's private behaviors.

> That said, after we talked with some of the complainants, and after extensive internal deliberation and discussion, Jacob stepped down from his position as an employee of The Tor Project.

Appelbaum's last message, prior to these allegations going public, was a tweet on the day he supposedly left the Tor Project: "[Changing of the guards](https://web.archive.org/web/20160605180001/https://twitter.com/ioerror/status/736259103790632960)." He remained silent until June 6th, where he [issued a statement](https://archive.is/YZ2co) using [TwitLonger](https://archive.is/I7Zhd), both to say that the allegations against him where "entirely false" and the "vicious and spurious" way they were delivered has made him "prepared to use legal channels, if necessary, to defend my reputation from these libelous accusations."

> Vague rumors and smear campaigns against me are nothing new. As a longtime public advocate for free speech and a secure internet, there have been plenty of attempts to undermine my work over the years.

> Now, however, these unsubstantiated and unfounded attacks have become so aggressive that I feel it’s necessary to set the record straight. Not only have I been the target of a fake website in my name that has falsely accused me of serious crimes, but I have also received death threats (including a Twitter handle entitled ‘TimeToDieJake’).

His publicist, [Claudia Tomassini](https://archive.is/eHxMD), told **WIRED** that his "[legal team is working on an injunction against these monstrous and factually incorrect accusations](https://archive.is/pCaSd#selection-1511.239-1511.444)." According to **The Daily Dot** she has "[walked back that statement](https://archive.is/QZIdh#selection-1039.170-1039.350)."

**Ars Technica** Senior Business Editor and journalist [Cyrus Farivar](https://web.archive.org/web/20160602030108/http://arstechnica.com/author/cyrus-farivar/) said he had a "[story forthcoming](https://archive.is/aGbcD)" on this event. He has since published two, the [first](https://web.archive.org/web/20160605131228/http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/06/tor-developer-jacob-appelbaum-quits-after-sexual-mistreatment-allegations/) summarizing the allegations and Tor's response, the [second](https://archive.is/v9tPj) on Appelbaum's response. A [screenshot of an email](https://archive.is/No8pV) sent to him indicates, like the blog post, that they're investigating the allegations.

### The Website and Twitter Account

The website [jacobappelbaum.net](https://archive.is/8m4Yk) (which may have [belonged to Appelbaum at some point](https://twitter.com/absinthol/status/739148659418402820)) appears to have been repurposed as a victim story bulletin board, with an attached [GitHub repository](https://archive.is/https://github.com/ioerrror/jacobappelbaum.net*) run by [an account created on May 26th](https://archive.is/c6sgC) that uses his name and Twitter/ GitHub handle (the only difference being an extra 'r'). Contrary to some suspicions that he had been hacked, his official website is listed on his Twitter profile as [appelbaum.net](https://archive.is/bPSlT#selection-1045.1-1045.15)). According to the [registration](https://archive.is/VMYhK) [information](https://archive.is/nMT7M#selection-1219.0-1219.29), the website was created using [**PrivacyProtect**](http://privacyprotect.org/about-privacyprotection/) on May 27th, two days after Appelbaum reportedly stepped down and the same day that [the resignation agreement from Steele is dated](https://web.archive.org/web/20160608122942/https://cryptome.org/2016/06/tor-appelbaum-separation.pdf). The domain is being [hosted by **GitHub** in San Francisco](https://archive.is/aA6HV) using [GitHub Pages](https://archive.is/W5UtY). The OpenPGP key given as a contact method is named "[Jacob Appelbaum's Victims Collective](https://archive.is/FPrQm)."

![site registration](https://crypto.quebec/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Capture.png)

A Twitter account, previously going by the handle "[@TimetoDieJake](https://archive.is/ucuwA)," has been changed to "[@VictimsOfJake](https://archive.is/tHhxh)" and is promoting the site (you can tell it's the same account because all the tweets match prior to the former's deletion). No one has publicly claimed the site or the Twitter account. On June 7th [an FAQ was added to the site](https://archive.is/avZNp#selection-1075.1-1075.254), in which it denied any association with the Twitter accounts:

> We have seen the accounts you're talking about and they aren't associated with us. We don't know who is running them, and some of us are disturbed by their incendiary statements and graphics. We don't condone calls for violence or for Jake to self-harm.

However, based on its [first tweet](https://archive.is/8R8Ax), the account had a suspiciously early awareness of the site. They linked to [the site in its early stages](https://web.archive.org/web/20160603224422/https://ioerrror.github.io/jacobappelbaum.net/) (using [a link that is no longer live](https://archive.is/W5UtY)), where it very explicitly claimed to be Appelbaum.

> Hey there! My name is Jacob Appelbaum. I'm pretty famous for stealing other people's research and putting my own name on it. I also spend a lot of my time pretending to be a badass hacker, but actually I can only barely code. I enjoy using my social capital, influence, and power in order to manipulate other people into getting what I want. From all that, it's pretty clear that I'm awesome! However, in several communities, I'm perhaps better known for my abuse of other people — sexually, emotionally, and physically.

Under the 'Victims' header it went into what at first seemed to be random speeches, though it appears to be filler text used in a few other places (see [this blog site ](https://archive.is/1c355) or the 'Manifest' section of [this site](https://archive.is/7E2T4#selection-211.0-211.12) which has an identical webpage format).

Shepard is the widely suspected creator of the site. She tweeted that it was not her "[choice to keep the sources this vague, but frankly, people are afraid of retaliation](https://archive.is/V0hZw#selection-3557.1-3557.98)." (I'm assuming she means retaliation from people other than Appelbaum, as the level of detail in the stories would enable him to figure out from memory who was saying what and thus defeat the attempt at anonymity). She [told **WIRED**](https://archive.is/pCaSd#selection-1517.163-1517.350) that the creator was a "longtime member of the Tor community” whom she knows and trusts. [Alison Macrina](https://archive.is/Q2TTK#selection-575.0-575.24), a Tor advocate, believes the Twitter account is a "[troll](https://web.archive.org/web/20160605165004/https://twitter.com/flexlibris/status/739146421023084544)" and "should be reported. [T]hey do not represent any of the victims I've talked to." However she later told **The Daily Dot** that the [website is authentic](https://archive.is/QZIdh#selection-1011.0-1019.230) and, like Shepard and an unnamed Tor employee, knows who is behind it.

Besides the alleged victims' stories themselves, the most alarming aspect of the website was the lack of good faith displayed by the tweet button at the bottom which prompted people to share the website as if it was owned and controlled by Appelbaum:

> I just read on [@ioerror](https://twitter.com/ioerror)'s homepage https://ioerrror.github.io/jacobappelbaum.net that he has sexually assaulted many people in #tech. #wtf

The site's FAQ now claims that they are "[a small group of people of different genders](https://archive.is/avZNp#selection-865.22-865.66)" who "[never meant to impersonate Jake or to trick anyone](https://archive.is/avZNp#selection-1189.110-1189.273). With the official text, we have tried to make it clear that it isn't pretending to be made by Jake himself." However they are still linking to his real GitHub account at the bottom of the page. The new tweet prompt text is:

> I just read on https://jacobappelbaum.net that [@ioerror](https://twitter.com/ioerror) has sexually assaulted many people in #tech.

The [last part of the FAQ](https://archive.is/avZNp#selection-1249.153-1249.432) states: "We do not believe that Jake is likely to ever face criminal charges. We know that some people will say that proves that the stories here aren't true. But we know that many people understand we are telling the truth, and we believe people will be safer because we made this site."

### The Allegations

`Warning: The following stories have not been authenticated! They are here only to document allegations.`

The website profiles eight separate claims from people who were "[harassed, plagiarized, humiliated, and abused — sexually, emotionally, and physically](https://archive.is/8m4Yk#selection-245.34-245.140)." Initially, half of them were marked as placeholders (Alice, Briar, Pheonix, and Sam), but the stories for "Sam" and "Phoenix" have since been added, along with more stories than the original eight (Kiwi and Nick). All are purposely under vague (i.e. anonymized) names. The GitHub copies of the entries are PNG images, all marked with the same date of December 31st, 2015; it is unclear what it signifies, but if anything it is most likely a date of submission. The anonymous entries are as follows:

+ "[Daniel](https://archive.is/R6nDq)," who was dating someone in the Tor community, says Appelbaum violated their privacy and propositioned them for sex.
+ "[Forest](https://archive.is/bUw87)," who was propositioned for sex and sexually assaulted while she was sleeping.
+ "[River](https://archive.is/0jbVl)," who was romantically involved with him, propositioned for group sex and while intoxicated was subjected to unwanted sexual advances by him and at least one of his friends at a party.
+ "[Sam](https://archive.is/Tn1fy)," who had a "minor romantic interest" in Appelbaum and was persuaded while intoxicated to get in a bathtub with him at his apartment, followed by verbal abuse when they resisted.
+ "[West](https://archive.is/TjhUQ)," who was kissed without consent by Appelbaum at a hacker event.
+ "[Kiwi](https://archive.is/N10bK)," who initially "joined the digital rights community because of him," was then subjected to shaming and embarassing situations by Appelbaum in public during the process of building their professional career.
+ "[Phoenix](https://archive.is/hxfzw)," who at a post-workshop dinner was publicly propositioned for sex twice and subjected to other behavior she found humiliating.

Only two people claiming to be victims of Appelbaum have publicly come forward, outside of the allegations of plagiarism by Patterson and Norton. The [first](https://archive.is/bFXW2) was [Nick Farr](https://archive.is/9kjWs), who so far is the only person with [a clear identity on the victims website](https://archive.is/vekwa). He alleges a span of incidents of verbal harassment which occured during the [**Chaos Communication Congress** event in 2013 (30c3)](https://web.archive.org/web/20160411055714/https://events.ccc.de/congress/2013/wiki/Main_Page), where he was an organizer of the Lightning Talks. After approving a proposal for a talk which was going to argue that Appelbaum was a US Intelligence Operative, he was chastised first via email and then in person multiple times by both Appelbaum and "important people in the CCC." Furthermore, he says [a note](https://archive.is/bFXW2#selection-373.84-373.139) was left every night on a pillow in his hotel room: "Don't make us use extreme measures. Hand it all over." The second is [Leigh Honeywell](https://archive.is/Cm3R9), a computer and network security professional, who says [she was in an open relationship](https://archive.is/77Sx2) with Appelbaum during 2006-2007.

> In that time we spent together, he violated boundaries I set as though they were a game, particularly at times when I was intoxicated. There were a number of times I felt afraid and violated during interactions with Jacob. Being involved with him was a steady stream of humiliations small and large as he mistreated me in front of others and over-shared about our intimate interactions with friends who were often also professional colleagues.

> For example, on several occasions in professional situations, he told other people that I was good at a particular sex act. On another occasion where my primary romantic partner at the time, [Paul Wouters](https://archive.is/yi79U), was also present, Jacob ignored my use of a safeword when his sexual behavior turned into violent behavior that violated my limits. Paul and I both had to repeatedly tell Jacob to stop, and the experience was profoundly upsetting.

[Emerson Tan](https://archive.is/TEIUh), another computer and network security professional, came forward as an "eyewitness" through an interview with both [**Gizmodo**](https://archive.is/K2tdt) and [**The Daily Dot**](https://archive.is/QZIdh). He says Patterson and Shepard also witnessed the incident, which occurred in the middle of the night (no date specified other than "[it was the day we arrived at CCC"](https://archive.is/QZIdh#selection-1047.91-1047.123)) during the [2015 **Chaos Communication Congress** (32c3)](https://web.archive.org/web/20160607230238/https://events.ccc.de/congress/2015/wiki/Static:Main_Page) in Hamburg, Germany.

> "At about 2 or 3 a.m. in the morning I happen to be talking to [Patterson], [Shepard] and Jacob Appelbaum and a group of other people who have come out of the congress hall into the lobby of the Raddison Blu hotel in Hamburg,” Tan told Gizmodo. “Jake has his hands all over this girl, and she is very obviously not very happy. You know, she’s looking for her bag, they’re having a conversation and she’s looking for her bag she can’t find her bag and she appears to be really quite distressed and Appelbaum forcibly attempts to try and kiss her, grabs her arm and her backside and makes a move for her breasts.

> ... And the other males who we were with were basically just kind of joking amongst themselves and don’t really seem to see anything wrong with it, which is really quite distressing,” Tan said. “So I watched this for about two to three minutes and then I decide to go and do something and just mount a very very subtle intervention. Which is, I go over, I shake Jake’s hand I tell him what a great job he’s doing with the Tor project and the rest of it and that gives the girl roughly the 30 seconds she needs to find her bag without being in an undistracted fashion. She left, and I found her hiding out in the hotel bar later, after Jake had left. She was pretty composed but obviously upset."

In **The Daily Dot** interview he gives far more detail, including what the girl, who Patterson says was "[obviously a little bit inebriated](https://archive.is/QZIdh#selection-1059.80-1059.113)," did [after the incident](https://archive.is/QZIdh#selection-1087.0-1087.256).

> Tan said afterwards he spoke briefly with the woman. He asked if she wanted to file a police report, but she was unwilling. She left the hotel before any of the witnesses learned who she was. The incident was never reported to police or to the Tor Project.

Tan posted the story on his Facebook page, saying that even though he didn't know who the girl was he had submitted it to Steele as part of the investigaton. He also mentions seeing Appelbaum "[trying to take upskirt photos of women" and "making lewd comments and allegations of threesomes with various members of the privacy community](https://archive.is/K2tdt#selection-1379.28-1379.233)." Shephard added that once when Appelbaum was "good drunk" in a bar in July of 2013, he "discussed how he would ‘use my ass’."

![Tan's Facebook posts](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CkX8kzqXEAA5azs.jpg)

As a [result](https://archive.is/q2zil) of the allegations, Appelbaum has been [removed](https://web.archive.org/web/20160606171748/http://w3.cultdeadcow.com/cms/team_bio.html) from the computer underground group [Cult of the Dead Cow (cDc)](https://web.archive.org/web/20160603052306/http://w3.cultdeadcow.com/cms/about.html), of which he has been [a member since July 2008](https://web.archive.org/web/20160312134611/http://w3.cultdeadcow.com/cms/team_bio.html). Their [official statement](https://archive.is/M1Kgd#selection-67.202-67.401) says that "as we have become aware of the anonymous accusations of sexual assault, as well as the stories told by individuals we know and trust, we've decided to remove Jake from the herd effective immediately."

Though he did not directly mention Applebaum by name or the allegations, [Daniel J. Bernstein](https://web.archive.org/web/20160607185552/https://twitter.com/hashbreaker), professor of mathematics and computer science at the [**Eindhoven University of Technology**](https://archive.is/7muWD#selection-18219.1-18219.26) where Appelbaum is currently studying, published a blog post warning of the consequences of skirting due process.

>  Is it really so hard to recognize both of these directions of error? If I prejudge and punish alleged culprits who have not had their day in court, then I will inevitably punish some innocent people: the unfortunate reality is that **many accusations of crimes are false**. If I prejudge and punish accusers who have not had their day in court, then I will inevitably punish some innocent people: the unfortunate reality is that **many accusations of crimes are true**.

> When I say "day in court", what I really mean is **due process**. Due process is a set of ethical principles that civilization has painstakingly developed over several centuries, recognizing that punishment is corrupted by many sources of error on both sides: communication is poor; memories are faulty; sometimes people don't tell the whole truth; sometimes people tell something other than the truth.

> ...  It's really not that hard to stay calm and say something like this: "We weren't there. At this point we can't be sure what happened. Sometimes accusations are true, and sometimes they aren't. It's important for a neutral judge to hear testimony from the accuser and from the accused."

> But not everyone stays calm. Angry people continue to join these mobs. They blog and tweet and report their ill-informed speculations in favor of the accuser or the accused, confident in their own righteousness and blithely unaware of the possibility of being wrong. Ultimately the accused and the accuser are both punished, truth be damned.
