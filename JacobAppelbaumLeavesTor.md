On June 2nd, 2016, Tor Project [Executive Director Shari Steele](https://archive.is/Q2TTK#selection-767.0-767.32) posted a ["transition" update](https://web.archive.org/web/20160603213021/https://blog.torproject.org/blog/jacob-appelbaum-leaves-tor-project) on the organization's blog:

> Long time digital advocate, security researcher, and developer Jacob Appelbaum stepped down from his position at The Tor Project on May 25, 2016.

Jacob Appelbaum officially [joined the Tor Project in 2008](https://web.archive.org/web/20150926185057/https://blog.torproject.org/blog/jacob-and-matt-join-tor-project) as part of the translation team, improving documentation for non-technical users, and advocacy for the Tor network in general. He also runs one of Tor's [directory authorities](https://archive.is/7jFmj#selection-4563.0-4569.364), a special server which maintains a list of all verified exit nodes and helps Tor clients find relays in the network (there were 8 of these in 2012; there are now 10).

On the 24th of May, one day before Appelbaum allegedly stepped down, core Tor developer [Andrea Shepard](https://archive.is/Q2TTK#selection-739.0-739.25) tweeted a [commitment hash](https://web.archive.org/web/20160603213504/https://twitter.com/puellavulnerata/status/735230102154448898) (i.e. [making a statement of secret value which can be authentically revealed in the future](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Commitment_scheme)). Within the same day that Steele announced Appelbaum's departure, Shepard [revealed the hash](https://archive.is/V0hZw#selection-26133.0-26133.78):

> [@puellavulnerata](https://archive.is/V0hZw): Precommitment revealed: sha256("It seems one rapist is one rapist too many\n")

(To verify this yourself using OpenSSL, type `echo It seems one rapist is one rapist too many | openssl sha256`, the output of which should be `(stdin)= bfb9a7c833a5fc8f5a938d816b1bbc4acaa06519fdb1af4c8632719596807dac`).

As people responded to the news about Appelbaum as well as these mysterious tweets, it became clear that they were connected after Meredith Patterson ([@maradydd](https://archive.is/1FYbO)) [tweeted about the lack of explanation in Steele's announcement](https://archive.is/1FYbO#selection-5199.0-5213.107).

> [blog.torproject.org/blog/jacob-appelbaum-leaves-tor-project](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/jacob-appelbaum-leaves-tor-project) is a gross disservice to the Tor community. People deserve to know why Tor evicted its resident sociopath. You don't just kick sociopaths down the road and play like you've done the necessary. That's extending their social license to operate. Tor had the chance to nip this in the bud back when Jake was just a plagiarist. They ignored it, and he graduated to sexual assault... Jake finally raped enough people that Tor as an organisation couldn't ignore it anymore.

As background to her assertion that he "graduated [from plagiarist] to sexual assault," it would be relevant to note that Patterson and Appelbaum have a history of being involved in [plagiarism disputes](https://web.archive.org/web/20160605152831/http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.otr.devel/1546), where Appelbaum was the accused, extending back prior to the passing of Len Sassaman (her husband), mentioned in [this thread](https://twitter.com/ioerror/status/302261054497509376) as "Len," in 2011. She recently [tweeted her account](https://archive.is/xuuCG) of an interaction with Appelbaum that followed that particular dispute, and [then said](https://archive.is/laWvR) that "Jake hasn't apologised to any of his assault/harassment victims that I know of either. And to everyone else trying to make hay out of that distinction, hairsplitting isn't a good look on you."

The majority of those who responded were [shocked and/ or asked for more information](https://web.archive.org/web/20160604033907/https://twitter.com/maradydd/status/738801590333624320), both about the rape allegations and the circumstances of Appelbaum stepping down; however none of the people who made the allegations offered more details.

On June 4th, Steele [released a longer public statement](https://archive.is/uOTpp) about the situation. Though it did confirm that *the allegations led to Appelbaum stepping down*, it did not reveal who or how many victims there allegedly are, only that the matter was being investigated with the help of "a legal firm that specializes in employment issues including sexual misconduct."

> Over the past several days, a number of people have made serious, public allegations of sexual mistreatment by former Tor Project employee Jacob Appelbaum. These types of allegations were not entirely new to everybody at Tor; they were consistent with rumors some of us had been hearing for some time. That said, the most recent allegations are much more serious and concrete than anything we had heard previously. We are deeply troubled by these accounts.

> We do not know exactly what happened here. We don't have all the facts, and we are undertaking several actions to determine them as best as possible. We're also not an investigatory body, and we are uncomfortable making judgments about people's private behaviors.

> That said, after we talked with some of the complainants, and after extensive internal deliberation and discussion, Jacob stepped down from his position as an employee of The Tor Project.

Appelbaum's last message, prior to these allegations going public, was a tweet on the day he supposedly left the Tor Project: "[Changing of the guards](https://web.archive.org/web/20160605180001/https://twitter.com/ioerror/status/736259103790632960)." He remained silent until June 6th, where he [issued a statement](https://archive.is/YZ2co) using [TwitLonger](https://archive.is/I7Zhd), both to say that the allegations against him where false & that the "vicious and spurious" way they were delivered has made him "prepared to use legal channels, if necessary, to defend my reputation from these libelous accusations."

> Vague rumors and smear campaigns against me are nothing new. As a longtime public advocate for free speech and a secure internet, there have been plenty of attempts to undermine my work over the years.

> Now, however, these unsubstantiated and unfounded attacks have become so aggressive that I feel it’s necessary to set the record straight. Not only have I been the target of a fake website in my name that has falsely accused me of serious crimes, but I have also received death threats (including a Twitter handle entitled ‘TimeToDieJake’).

His publicist, [Claudia Tomassini](https://archive.is/eHxMD), told **WIRED** that his "[legal team is working on an injunction against these monstrous and factually incorrect accusations](https://archive.is/pCaSd#selection-1511.239-1511.444)."

**Ars Technica** Senior Business Editor and journalist [Cyrus Farivar](https://web.archive.org/web/20160602030108/http://arstechnica.com/author/cyrus-farivar/) said he had a "[story forthcoming](https://archive.is/aGbcD)" on this event, which was then [published the next day](https://web.archive.org/web/20160605131228/http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/06/tor-developer-jacob-appelbaum-quits-after-sexual-mistreatment-allegations/). A [screenshot of an email](https://archive.is/No8pV) sent to him indicates, like the blog post, that they're investigating the allegations.

`Note: Though surname & email address are blacked out, 'Kate' is likely Communications Director Kate Krauss.`

The website [jacobappelbaum.net](https://archive.is/8m4Yk) (which may have [belonged to Appelbaum at some point](https://twitter.com/absinthol/status/739148659418402820)) appears to have been repurposed as a victim story bulletin board, with an attached [GitHub repository](https://archive.is/https://github.com/ioerrror/jacobappelbaum.net*) run by [an account created on May 26th](https://archive.is/c6sgC) that uses his name and Twitter/ GitHub handle (the only difference being an extra 'r'). (Note that his official website is listed on his Twitter profile as [appelbaum.net](https://archive.is/bPSlT#selection-1045.1-1045.15)). According to the [registration](https://archive.is/VMYhK) [information](https://archive.is/nMT7M#selection-1219.0-1219.29), the website was created on May 27th, two days after Appelbaum reportedly stepped down, and the domain is being [hosted by GitHub in San Francisco](https://archive.is/aA6HV) (it is possible that this is being done through [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)). The OpenPGP key given as a contact method is named "[Jacob Appelbaum's Victims Collective](https://archive.is/FPrQm)."

![site registration](https://crypto.quebec/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Capture.png)

A Twitter account, previously going by the handle "[@TimetoDieJake](https://archive.is/ucuwA)", has been changed to "[@VictimsOfJake](https://archive.is/tHhxh)" and is promoting the site (you can tell it's the same account because all the tweets match prior to the former's deletion). However, as no one has publicly claimed the site or the Twitter account, no one except Shepard seems to know who is behind them or even if they're the same person. Shepard is the widely suspected creator of the site, though she tweeted that it was not her "[choice to keep the sources this vague, but frankly, people are afraid of retaliation](https://archive.is/V0hZw#selection-3557.1-3557.98)." (I'm assuming she means retaliation from people other than Appelbaum, as the level of detail in the stories would enable him to figure out from memory who was saying what and thus defeat the attempt at anonymity). She [told **WIRED**](https://archive.is/pCaSd#selection-1517.163-1517.350) that the creator was a "longtime member of the Tor community” whom she knows and trusts. [Alison Macrina](https://archive.is/Q2TTK#selection-575.0-575.24), a Tor advocate, believes the account is a "[troll](https://web.archive.org/web/20160605165004/https://twitter.com/flexlibris/status/739146421023084544)" and "should be reported. [T]hey do not represent any of the victims I've talked to." 

Besides the alleged victims' stories themselves, the most alarming aspect of the website is the lack of good faith displayed by the tweet button at the bottom which prompts people to share the website as if it was owned and controlled by Appelbaum:

> I just read on [@ioerror](https://twitter.com/ioerror)'s homepage https://ioerrror.github.io/jacobappelbaum.net that he has sexually assaulted many people in #tech. #wtf

`Warning: The following stories have not been authenticated! They are here only to document allegations.`

The website profiles eight separate claims of sexual misconduct. Initially, half of them were marked as "placeholders" (Alice, Briar, Pheonix, and Sam), but the story for "Sam" has since been added. All are purposely under vague (i.e. anonymized) names. The GitHub copies of the entries are PNG images, all marked with the same date of December 31st, 2015; it is unclear what it signifies, but if anything it is most likely a date of submission. The non-placeholder entries are as follows:

+ "[Daniel](https://archive.is/R6nDq)," who was dating someone in the Tor community, says Appelbaum violated their privacy and propositioned them for sex.
+ "[Forest](https://archive.is/bUw87)," who was propositioned for sex and sexually assaulted while she was sleeping.
+ "[River](https://archive.is/0jbVl)," who was romantically involved with him, propositioned for group sex and while intoxicated was subjected to unwanted sexual advances by him and at least one of his friends at a party.
+ "[Sam](https://archive.is/Tn1fy)," who had a "minor romantic interest" and was persuaded while intoxicated to get in a bathtub with him at his apartment, followed by verbal abuse when they resisted.
+ "[West](https://archive.is/TjhUQ)," who was kissed without consent by Appelbaum at a hacker event.

Only [one person](https://archive.is/9kjWs) claiming to be a victim of Appelbaum has [publicly come forward](https://archive.is/bFXW2) and said they submitted a story to the site. So far he has alleged a span of incidents of verbal harassment which occured during the [**Chaos Communication Congress** event in 2013 (30c3)](https://web.archive.org/web/20160411055714/https://events.ccc.de/congress/2013/wiki/Main_Page), where he was an organizer of the Lightning Talks. After approving a proposal for a talk which was going to argue that Appelbaum was a US Intelligence Operative, he was chastised first via email and then in person multiple times by both Appelbaum and "important people in the CCC." Furthermore, he says [a note](https://archive.is/bFXW2#selection-373.84-373.139) was left every night on a pillow in his hotel room: "Don't make us use extreme measures. Hand it all over."
