### The History

[Jacob Appelbaum](https://archive.is/GItar) officially [joined the Tor Project in 2008](https://web.archive.org/web/20150926185057/https://blog.torproject.org/blog/jacob-and-matt-join-tor-project) as part of the translation team, improving documentation for non-technical users, and advocacy for the Tor network in general. He also runs one of Tor's [directory authorities](https://archive.is/7jFmj#selection-4563.0-4569.364), a special server which maintains a list of all verified exit nodes and helps Tor clients find relays in the network (there were 8 of these in 2012; there are now 10).

`Note: This section is for events or statements leading up to Appelbaum's resignation which may be relevant.`

At the [**Chaos Communication Congress**](https://archive.is/FQsDm) in December of 2014, Appelbaum and [Tor Project director](https://archive.is/WTt5r#selection-247.0-247.54) [Roger Dingledine](https://twitter.com/RogerDingledine) presented the "[State of the Onion](https://media.ccc.de/v/31c3_-_6251_-_en_-_saal_1_-_201412301400_-_state_of_the_onion_-_jacob_-_arma)" for 31c3. Three minutes in, Appelbaum started speaking about "[a sustained campaign of online harassment](https://archive.is/iyJKZ)" which had been [directed](https://archive.is/ljqM4) at [core Tor developer](https://archive.is/Q2TTK#selection-739.0-739.25) [Andrea Shepard](https://archive.is/yF1cg) "for the past several months." 

> APPELBAUM: It is the case that there's a person in our community, and many persons in our community, that have come under attack and have been deeply harassed. We think that sucks and we don't like that. Even though we promote anonymity without any question, that is no backdoors ever (and we'll get back to that in a minute), it is the case that we really want to promote being excellent to each other (in the spirit of Noisebridge). [...] It isn't the case that we're saying you shouldn't have the right to say things, but we are saying "get the fuck out of our community" if you're going to be abusive to women.

> And you'll note that I used the word "fuck" to say it; I'm sorry about that because the point is we all make mistakes and we want to make sure that, while it's true that we have transgressions, we want to make sure that we can find a place of reconcilliation and we can work towards conflict resolution. It's important at the same time to recognize that there are people whose real lives are harmed by harassment online. In this case, one of the people is in this audience and I hope that they won't mind be named, but we want to give her a shout-out and say that we stand behind her a hundred percent.

> DINGLEDINE: One of our developers on core Tor, Andrea, has been harassed on Twitter and elsewhere, really a lot more than should happen to anybody. 

> [...] She's not just being attacked because she happens to be there, she's being attacked because they're trying to attack the Tor Project and all the other people in Tor; so yes, she may be the focus of some of the attacks but we, the rest of the Tor community, the rest of the security community, need to stand up and take on some of this burden of communicating, interacting and talk about these issues. We can't just leave it to her to defend herself.

As Appelbaum follows up with, [the](https://archive.is/Da9Mu) [harassment](https://archive.is/3yp8b) seemed to center on the topic of [Tor's funding from the U.S. government](https://archive.is/OQlhR), a debate which has been raging basically since its inception.

Based on a [letter](https://archive.is/5zlA0) published by [**Golem.de**](https://archive.is/J7rxB) through [**FearlessBlogging.com**](https://archive.is/aVULh) (an anonymous blog site), Tor Project's then [human relations manager](https://archive.is/Q2TTK#selection-515.0-515.12) [Tom Leckrone](https://archive.is/rYKWV) wrote to Appelbaum on March 18th 2015 that he was "expected to engage... on performance and conduct issues" as part of a Performance Improvement Plan following "an unpaid suspension for a period of ten business days" from March 20th to March 30th. The suspension was due to incidents which took place on March 3rd and 6th during a [core Tor team company meeting](https://archive.is/DrGwH) in Valencia, Spain. (This was also the week of the [**Circumvention Tech Festival**](https://archive.is/9klki), during which Appelbaum [tweeted](https://archive.is/ooFR7) they needed help identifying a [suspicious GPS tracking device](https://archive.is/tbdfC) found on an [attendee's](https://archive.is/KDYAy) vehicle.) The letter states:

> As you know, a community member advanced a complaint that included two separate instances. One of the instances involved a provocative conversation on the afternoon of March 6th. The person to whom you were speaking was not offended, but the provocative conversation could be overheard by others and created an unwelcoming environment.

> The other incident raises more serious concerns regarding Tor Project’s obligation to ensure a safe and comfortable work environment, especially as regards an environment that is unwelcoming or hostile to protected classes of community members. In this case, you made statements that implied that new community members were recruited in a sexually charged manner. This was made during the course of a Tor Project-sanctioned work session which you took part in leading. The very statement that the inception of a working relationship was in any way influenced by sexual conduct or even innuendo is offensive, especially in an environment where Tor Project is actively working to ensure that all community members are able to engage and advance themselves based on their skills and willingness to contribute rather than other attributes.

> ... In the repartee that followed, you expressly stated that the offensive sexualized recruitment “strategy” had “worked” with the complainant. This statement created an inappropriate and unwelcome environment for the complainant, and, indeed, any bystander who overheard this statement would be likely to perceive that the work environment at Tor Project was not welcoming and supportive of merit-based work.

He also warned Appelbaum that he should resign if he didn't want to follow the terms of suspension or the Performance Improvement Plan; even if he did comply, he could have his employment terminated if "[further performance or conduct issues ensue](https://archive.is/5zlA0#selection-315.0-315.402)." It may be relevant that Appelbaum was [told to contact Executive Director Andrew Lewman](https://archive.is/5zlA0#selection-323.0-323.81), who had been with the Tor Project [since 2009](https://archive.is/XVYVt#selection-115.15-115.102) and then chose to [leave](https://archive.is/uC18m) less than a month after this letter was sent (the position was [filled](https://archive.is/cKnF2) by Roger Dingledine in May). 

According to [**Buzzfeed**](https://archive.is/wvbwZ) (who spoke with yet unnamed sources) the "community member" who advanced the complaint which precipitated this letter was then [Development Director Karen Reilly](https://archive.is/WTt5r#selection-673.0-673.34) (oddly not listed under past contributors, while [Lewman](https://archive.is/RPj8I#selection-411.0-411.40) is; this is [the last archived page](https://web.archive.org/web/20150416074507/https://www.torproject.org/about/corepeople.html.en) she appears in).

> She told [the board of the Tor Project] about Appelbaum’s public and false claims that he had sex with a specific member of the Tor community — something multiple sources have told BuzzFeed News Appelbaum has “done to too many people to count.” And she told them of darker allegations against him that had come up after a group of disgusted Tor community members gathered to share stories.

> ...According to sources, Appelbaum’s behavior had been the talk of the conference. Reilly had separately approached Lewman, Dingledine, Mathewson, and Seltzer in Valencia and told them of the harassment.

> At dinner, the conversation turned to Appelbaum after Gardner, not yet a Tor employee, broached the subject. According to a source with knowledge of the dinner, Gardner said her friends had been asking her why she was working with an organization that employs a rapist. After that, Reilly “rehashed everything.”

> ... Following the dinner, according to sources, Tor conducted a human resources inquiry into the matter.

Like Appelbaum, Reilly was also given a ten-day suspension, but for "[spreading rumors about the Tor Project](https://archive.is/wvbwZ#selection-2959.100-2959.217)." It is not stated what kind of rumours, about whom, or by what [medium](https://archive.is/qMQU7). Unlike Appelbaum, she didn't take the offer and left; no mention was made of her departure in Tor Project blog announcements.

**Golem.de** claims they have confirmed the authenticity of the letter ("... [die Echtheit der Mail bestätigt](https://archive.is/J7rxB#selection-547.109-547.219)."), though the submitter remains anonymous and the Tor Project has [not confirmed it](https://archive.is/vM92Z#selection-4191.1-4201.77). **Ars Technica** Senior Business Editor and journalist [Cyrus Farivar](https://web.archive.org/web/20160602030108/http://arstechnica.com/author/cyrus-farivar/) has [also published](https://archive.is/vVDQC) a copy of the [internal email](https://web.archive.org/web/20160610033307/https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2858268/Appelbaum-Wurde-Im-Jahr-2015-Ausgesetzt.pdf), which he said was [sent to him anonymously](https://archive.is/vM92Z#selection-3259.8-3259.19).

On the 17th and 18th (when Leckrone sent the suspension email), Appelbaum tweeted:

> I wonder what the best defenses are for JTRIG-ish psyops? Just buckle in and move slow? Refuse to be split? Refuse to be atomized? ([March 17th](https://archive.is/nW5Is))


> That feeling that manifests when it is time to move on. Intensely. ([March 18th](https://archive.is/1vhhn))

![JTRIG chart](https://archive.li/kDzXc/b2a926bb585face74776c6ccd5343e831cb4dc43.png)

"[JTRIG](https://archive.is/zhdGz)" is the acronym for a unit of GCHQ, the **Joint Threat Research Intelligence Group**, which uses psychological manipulation tactics to infiltrate and destroy activist groups by understanding, shaping, and controlling how discourse unfolds. The **Human Science Operations Cell** (HSOC) is a division of GCHQ which focuses on online human intelligence. Documents outlining their purpose and methods were among those [leaked by Edward Snowden](https://archive.is/5v3pP) (with which [Appelbaum was closely involved](https://archive.is/skoYv)) and subsequently published through media outlets with access to the archives. In [February 2014](https://archive.is/kDzXc), Glenn Greenwald released a series of documents on JTRIG, including "[The Art of Deception: Training for a New Generation of Online Covert Operations](https://theintercept.com/document/2014/02/24/art-deception-training-new-generation-online-covert-operations/)," in which they outline their goals to create "cyber magicians" who can manipulate targets at individual, group, and global levels using social psychology.

> Among the core self-identified purposes of JTRIG are two tactics: **(1)** to inject all sorts of false material onto the internet in order to destroy the reputation of its targets; and **(2)** to use social sciences and other techniques to manipulate online discourse and activism to generate outcomes it considers desirable. To see how extremist these programs are, just consider the tactics they boast of using to achieve those ends: “false flag operations” (posting material to the internet and falsely attributing it to someone else), fake victim blog posts (pretending to be a victim of the individual whose reputation they want to destroy), and posting “negative information” on various forums. 

Over a year later on April 13th, 2016, Appelbaum delivered a [speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJValv4YQcY) [[transcript](https://archive.is/FrTlr)] he self-described as "journalistic suicide" at the [**Logan Center for Investigative Journalism** (CIJ) Symposium](https://archive.is/ZgsyC) in Berlin, Germany. During the speech he outlined how he and other investigative journalists had been betrayed by establishment journalists (particularly at **The Guardian** which he called the "shittiest publication in the English language") to the point where their lives were at risk.

### The Resignation

On June 2nd, 2016, Tor Project [Executive Director Shari Steele](https://archive.is/Q2TTK#selection-767.0-767.32) posted a ["transition" update](https://web.archive.org/web/20160603213021/https://blog.torproject.org/blog/jacob-appelbaum-leaves-tor-project) on the organization's blog:

> Long time digital advocate, security researcher, and developer Jacob Appelbaum stepped down from his position at The Tor Project on May 25, 2016.

A few days later, his name was [removed from the list](https://archive.is/yxqlC) of core Tor Project employees and volunteers.

On the 24th of May 2016, one day before Appelbaum stepped down, [core Tor developer](https://archive.is/Q2TTK#selection-739.0-739.25) [Andrea Shepard](https://archive.is/ol0mQ) tweeted a [commitment hash](https://web.archive.org/web/20160603213504/https://twitter.com/puellavulnerata/status/735230102154448898) (i.e. [making a statement of secret value which can be authentically revealed in the future](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Commitment_scheme)). Within the same day that Steele announced Appelbaum's departure, Shepard [revealed the hash](https://archive.is/V0hZw#selection-26133.0-26133.78):

> [@puellavulnerata](https://archive.is/V0hZw): Precommitment revealed: sha256("It seems one rapist is one rapist too many\n")

(To verify this yourself using OpenSSL, type `echo It seems one rapist is one rapist too many | openssl sha256`, the output of which should be `(stdin)= bfb9a7c833a5fc8f5a938d816b1bbc4acaa06519fdb1af4c8632719596807dac`).

The **Eindhoven Institute for the Protection of Systems and Information** (Ei/PSI) also published the schedule of speakers for their "[Security in Times of Surveillance](https://web.archive.org/web/20160506055357/http://www.win.tue.nl/eipsi/surveillance.html)" event on May 26th. Sometime between [the 24th and the 26th](https://archive.is/vhO8h#selection-2149.0-2177.6), Appelbaum's talk "Beyond End-to-End Encryption" was [cancelled](https://archive.is/JzF0j#selection-443.0-449.15), the reason only noted as "sickness."

On May 27th, Steele reportedly [requested that Appelbaum sign a resignation agreement](https://web.archive.org/web/20160608122942/https://cryptome.org/2016/06/tor-appelbaum-separation.pdf) in which he would promise "[mutual non-disparagement](https://archive.is/FP1GE)," including giving up the right to sue the Tor Project. According to the attached explanation by John Young ([**Cryptome.org**](https://cryptome.org/)), Appelbaum refused to sign the agreement.

As people responded to the news about Appelbaum as well as these mysterious tweets, it became clear that they were connected after technology researcher and writer [Meredith Patterson](https://web.archive.org/web/20160325052441/http://www.thesmartpolitenerd.com/aboutme.html) ([@maradydd](https://archive.is/1FYbO)) tweeted about [the lack of explanation in Steele's announcement](https://archive.is/1FYbO#selection-5199.0-5213.107).

> [blog.torproject.org/blog/jacob-appelbaum-leaves-tor-project](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/jacob-appelbaum-leaves-tor-project) is a gross disservice to the Tor community. People deserve to know why Tor evicted its resident sociopath. You don't just kick sociopaths down the road and play like you've done the necessary. That's extending their social license to operate. Tor had the chance to nip this in the bud back when Jake was just a plagiarist. They ignored it, and he graduated to sexual assault... Jake finally raped enough people that Tor as an organisation couldn't ignore it anymore.

As background to her assertion that he "graduated [from plagiarist] to sexual assault," it would be relevant to note that Patterson and Appelbaum have a history of being involved in [plagiarism disputes](https://web.archive.org/web/20160605152831/http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.otr.devel/1546), where Appelbaum was the accused, extending back prior to the passing of Len Sassaman (her husband), mentioned in [this thread](https://twitter.com/ioerror/status/302261054497509376) as "Len," in 2011. She recently [tweeted her account](https://archive.is/xuuCG) of an interaction with Appelbaum which followed that particular dispute, and [then said](https://archive.is/laWvR) that "Jake hasn't apologised to any of his assault/harassment victims that I know of either. And to everyone else trying to make hay out of that distinction, hairsplitting isn't a good look on you." American journalist [Quinn Norton](https://archive.is/GIttq) also joined her in [claiming involvement in plagiarism disputes](https://archive.is/5Sywt) with Appelbuam. They have yet to specify, or present evidence of, what work he plagiarised. ([**Cryptocat**](https://web.archive.org/web/20160614234138/https://crypto.cat/mission.html) developer Nadim Kobeissi has also [argued with Appelbaum in the past with regards to attribution rights](https://archive.is/ub4CH), but outside of [one tweet](https://archive.is/GW6T0) on the subject has stayed out of the debate because he "[thought a bit more about things and decided I had better things to emotionally invest myself in than an angry riot](https://archive.is/tPnaQ).") 

The majority of those who responded were [shocked and/ or asked for more information](https://web.archive.org/web/20160604033907/https://twitter.com/maradydd/status/738801590333624320), both about the rape allegations and the circumstances of Appelbaum stepping down. According to **Süddeutsche Zeitung**, a Munich daily newspaper, the Berlin Public Prosecution Office is not aware of any claims to date against Appelbaum ("[Die Berliner Staatsanwaltschaft ermittelt nach eigenen Angaben bislang nicht gegen Jacob Appelbaum](https://archive.is/5D41r#selection-2189.168-2189.267)").

On June 4th, Steele [released a longer public statement](https://archive.is/uOTpp) about the situation. Though it did confirm that the allegations led to Appelbaum stepping down, it did not reveal who or how many victims there allegedly are, only that the matter was being investigated with the help of "a legal firm that specializes in employment issues including sexual misconduct."

> Over the past several days, a number of people have made serious, public allegations of sexual mistreatment by former Tor Project employee Jacob Appelbaum. These types of allegations were not entirely new to everybody at Tor; they were consistent with rumors some of us had been hearing for some time. That said, the most recent allegations are much more serious and concrete than anything we had heard previously. We are deeply troubled by these accounts.

> We do not know exactly what happened here. We don't have all the facts, and we are undertaking several actions to determine them as best as possible. We're also not an investigatory body, and we are uncomfortable making judgments about people's private behaviors.

> That said, after we talked with some of the complainants, and after extensive internal deliberation and discussion, Jacob stepped down from his position as an employee of The Tor Project.

Appelbaum's last message, prior to these allegations going public, was a tweet on the day he supposedly left the Tor Project: "[Changing of the guards](https://web.archive.org/web/20160605180001/https://twitter.com/ioerror/status/736259103790632960)." He remained silent until June 6th, when he [issued a statement](https://archive.is/YZ2co) using [TwitLonger](https://archive.is/I7Zhd), both to say that the allegations against him where "entirely false" and the "vicious and spurious" way they were delivered has made him "prepared to use legal channels, if necessary, to defend my reputation from these libelous accusations."

> Vague rumors and smear campaigns against me are nothing new. As a longtime public advocate for free speech and a secure internet, there have been plenty of attempts to undermine my work over the years.

> Now, however, these unsubstantiated and unfounded attacks have become so aggressive that I feel it’s necessary to set the record straight. Not only have I been the target of a fake website in my name that has falsely accused me of serious crimes, but I have also received death threats (including a Twitter handle entitled ‘TimeToDieJake’).

An international film publicist, [Claudia Tomassini](https://archive.is/eHxMD), told **WIRED** that Appelbaum's "[legal team is working on an injunction against these monstrous and factually incorrect accusations](https://archive.is/pCaSd#selection-1511.239-1511.444)." According to **The Daily Dot** she has "[walked back that statement](https://archive.is/QZIdh#selection-1039.170-1039.350)," instead [saying](https://archive.is/Qdima#selection-1115.0-1123.169) that he “deserves as fair a hearing as anybody who comes forward with grievances against him.” She also clarified that Appelbaum was not her client; her involvement with him arose at least partially out of one of her [media publicity projects](https://archive.is/XbC4k), [Laura Poitras](https://archive.is/eyCfz)' [*Risk*](https://archive.is/BZUi0), a documentary film on the cypherpunk underground which [features Appelbaum](http://www.claudiatomassini.com/uploads/media/RISK_POITRAS_PRESSNOTES.pdf).

Farivar said he had a "[story forthcoming](https://archive.is/aGbcD)" on this event. He has since published two, the [first](https://web.archive.org/web/20160605131228/http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/06/tor-developer-jacob-appelbaum-quits-after-sexual-mistreatment-allegations/) summarizing the allegations and Tor's response, the [second](https://archive.is/v9tPj) on Appelbaum's response. A [screenshot of an email](https://archive.is/No8pV) sent to him indicates, like the blog post, that they're investigating the allegations.

### The Website and Twitter Accounts

The website [jacobappelbaum.net](https://archive.is/8m4Yk) has been created as a victim story bulletin board, with an attached [GitHub repository](https://archive.is/https://github.com/ioerrror/jacobappelbaum.net*) run by [an account created on May 26th](https://archive.is/c6sgC) that uses his name and Twitter/ GitHub handle (the only difference being an extra 'r'). Contrary to some suspicions that he had been hacked, his official website is listed on his Twitter profile as [appelbaum.net](https://archive.is/bPSlT#selection-1045.1-1045.15). According to the [registration](https://archive.is/VMYhK) [information](https://archive.is/nMT7M#selection-1219.0-1219.29), the website was created using [**PrivacyProtect**](http://privacyprotect.org/about-privacyprotection/) on May 27th, two days after Appelbaum reportedly stepped down and the same day that [the resignation agreement from Steele is dated](https://web.archive.org/web/20160608122942/https://cryptome.org/2016/06/tor-appelbaum-separation.pdf). The domain is being [hosted by **GitHub** in San Francisco](https://archive.is/aA6HV) using [GitHub Pages](https://archive.is/W5UtY). The OpenPGP key given as a contact method is named "[Jacob Appelbaum's Victims Collective](https://archive.is/FPrQm)."

![site registration](https://crypto.quebec/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Capture.png)

Three Twitter accounts were created in response to Appelbaum's resignation. The first, previously going by the handle "[@TimetoDieJake](https://archive.is/ucuwA)," has been changed to "[@VictimsOfJake](https://archive.is/tHhxh)" and is promoting the victim website (you can tell it's the same account because all the tweets match prior to the former's deletion). The [profile picture](https://archive.is/e9X6Y) for both is a [psychosurrealist](https://archive.is/tdi4a#selection-281.288-281.418) piece called "[Castrate Cure](https://archive.is/dR6X7)," portraying a small female figure using a guillotine to perform a [penectomy](http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/penectomy) on a giant man. No one has publicly claimed the site or the Twitter account. On June 7th [an FAQ was added to the site](https://archive.is/avZNp#selection-1075.1-1075.254), in which it denied any association with the Twitter accounts:

> We have seen the accounts you're talking about and they aren't associated with us. We don't know who is running them, and some of us are disturbed by their incendiary statements and graphics. We don't condone calls for violence or for Jake to self-harm.

However, based on its [first tweet](https://archive.is/8R8Ax), the account had a suspiciously early awareness of the site and also has knowledge of [Patterson](https://archive.is/mhDRh) [blaming Appelbaum for Len Sassaman's suicide](https://archive.is/fP0A9). It is [unlikely](https://archive.is/W83f6) that they are a native German. They linked to [the site in its early stages](https://web.archive.org/web/20160603224422/https://ioerrror.github.io/jacobappelbaum.net/) (using [a link that is no longer live](https://archive.is/W5UtY)), where it very explicitly claimed to be Appelbaum.

> Hey there! My name is Jacob Appelbaum. I'm pretty famous for stealing other people's research and putting my own name on it. I also spend a lot of my time pretending to be a badass hacker, but actually I can only barely code. I enjoy using my social capital, influence, and power in order to manipulate other people into getting what I want. From all that, it's pretty clear that I'm awesome! However, in several communities, I'm perhaps better known for my abuse of other people — sexually, emotionally, and physically.

Under the 'Victims' header it went into what at first seemed to be random speeches, though it appears to be filler text used in a few other places (see [this blog site ](https://archive.is/1c355) or the 'Manifest' section of [this site](https://archive.is/7E2T4#selection-211.0-211.12) which has an identical webpage format).

Shepard is the widely suspected creator of the site. She tweeted that it was not her "[choice to keep the sources this vague, but frankly, people are afraid of retaliation](https://archive.is/V0hZw#selection-3557.1-3557.98)." (I'm assuming she means retaliation from people other than Appelbaum, as the level of detail in the stories would enable him to figure out from memory who was saying what and thus defeat the attempt at anonymity). She [told **WIRED**](https://archive.is/pCaSd#selection-1517.163-1517.350) that the creator was a "longtime member of the Tor community” whom she knows and trusts. [Alison Macrina](https://archive.is/Q2TTK#selection-575.0-575.24), a Tor advocate, believes the Twitter account is a "[troll](https://web.archive.org/web/20160605165004/https://twitter.com/flexlibris/status/739146421023084544)" and "should be reported. [T]hey do not represent any of the victims I've talked to." However she later told **The Daily Dot** that the [website is authentic](https://archive.is/QZIdh#selection-1011.0-1019.230) and she, like Shepard and an unnamed Tor employee, knows who is behind it.

Besides the alleged victims' stories themselves, the most alarming aspect of the website was the lack of good faith displayed by the tweet button at the bottom which prompted people to share the website as if it was owned and controlled by Appelbaum:

> I just read on [@ioerror](https://twitter.com/ioerror)'s homepage https://ioerrror.github.io/jacobappelbaum.net that he has sexually assaulted many people in #tech. #wtf

The site's FAQ now claims that they are "[a small group of people of different genders](https://archive.is/avZNp#selection-865.22-865.66)" who "[never meant to impersonate Jake or to trick anyone](https://archive.is/avZNp#selection-1189.110-1189.273). With the official text, we have tried to make it clear that it isn't pretending to be made by Jake himself." However they are still linking to his real GitHub account at the bottom of the page and their contact email is **ioerror@riseup.net**. The new tweet prompt text is:

> I just read on https://jacobappelbaum.net that [@ioerror](https://twitter.com/ioerror) has sexually assaulted many people in #tech.

The [last part of the FAQ](https://archive.is/avZNp#selection-1249.153-1249.432) states: "We do not believe that Jake is likely to ever face criminal charges. We know that some people will say that proves that the stories here aren't true. But we know that many people understand we are telling the truth, and we believe people will be safer because we made this site."

The second Twitter account, "[@Ioerror_info](https://archive.is/cFDr1)," was made several days later. On June 9th, its first tweet was an alternative version of a story published by **Gizmodo** and **The Daily Dot** [see below under 'Allegations']. Like the first Twitter account, it is unknown who is behind it.

The third twitter account, "[JakeTheRaper](https://archive.is/Xfipv)," was made on June 14th. It mutually followed [an account](https://archive.is/ToNmk) which has been amplifying anti-Appelbaum tweets, especially those with a [mock-solidarity button](https://archive.is/qFfnZ) which [Shepard also liked](https://archive.is/gUCRQ). It links to a [GitHub repository](https://archive.is/9x9qC) that was created on [June 12th](https://archive.is/3PK07), run by [Caleb James DeLisle](https://archive.is/V715e) ([@cjdelisle](https://archive.is/TzJIL)), the [lead developer of **cjdns**](https://archive.is/P37aF) and [project admin](https://archive.is/lvtgI#selection-1645.0-1645.19) for [**XWiki**](https://archive.is/Bgsjv#selection-303.1-321.1), who told me that he [does not support the message of that account](https://archive.is/ZVKLz) and has [added a disclaimer](https://archive.is/qUtfY#selection-821.0-821.445) (as did I when it decided to [link here](https://archive.is/bccqo#selection-1031.1-1031.27) instead, as the account violates my anti-harassment policy).

### The Allegations

`Warning: Many of these stories haven't been verified or vouched for! They are here to document allegations.`

The website profiles eight separate claims from people who were "[harassed, plagiarized, humiliated, and abused — sexually, emotionally, and physically](https://archive.is/8m4Yk#selection-245.34-245.140)." Initially, half of them were marked as placeholders ([Alice](https://archive.is/NdMrJ#selection-647.0-649.0), [Briar](https://archive.is/ZivH4#selection-647.0-649.0), Pheonix, and Sam), but the stories for "Sam" and "Phoenix" have since been added, along with more stories than the original eight (Kiwi and Nick). All, except for Nick's, are purposely under vague (i.e. anonymized) names. The GitHub copies of the entries are PNG images, the text of which is colored blue in odd places. Initially, all the entries were marked with the same date of December 31st, 2015; since then, newer entries have not only been given different dates but the dates on earlier entries were changed (you can [compare them in the archives](https://archive.is/https://github.com/ioerrror/jacobappelbaum.net*)). It is unclear what the date signifies. Synopses of what is alleged (ordered by their dates) on the website are as follows:

+ "[Phoenix](https://archive.is/hxfzw)," who at a post-workshop dinner was publicly propositioned for sex twice and subjected to other behavior she found humiliating ([January 26th, 2016](https://archive.is/jUxNM#selection-645.1-649.0)). [William Budington](https://archive.is/Hs1mS), a software engineer for the **Electronic Frontier Foundation**, has [personally vouched](https://archive.is/eRXca) for this story's authenticity; Micah Lee from [**The Intercept**](https://archive.is/Fydks) also [appears](https://archive.is/s32Fe) to have done so.

> Based on the details provided, this incident likely occurred around the Berlin [Speakeasy](https://archive.is/X5dsZ) organized by [the **Electronic Frontier Foundation** (EFF) and the **Freedom of the Press Foundation** (FPF)](https://archive.is/gSS8z) on July 13th, 2014. Budington was indeed [in Berlin](https://archive.is/xKMXM) as an attendee, along with [Micah Lee](https://archive.is/x6Hqt), [Runa Sandvik](https://archive.is/q3B1D) (who [joined FPF](https://archive.is/r00mR) a [month before](https://archive.is/vI551#selection-361.335-361.344)), and [Yan Zhu](https://archive.is/TOzVd) who [hosted a get-together the day before](https://archive.is/yL13e) and now claims [she left before the incident occurred](https://archive.is/3WsXN). Considering it was a "workshop on whistleblowing platforms," it was probably a [**GlobaLeaks**](https://archive.is/NwR7M#selection-3187.5-3187.56) and/ or [**SecureDrop** event](https://archive.is/bSGV8) occuring sometime between the [12th and 17th of July](https://archive.is/5dhs5), the topic of which may be similar to what Budington and [Zhu](https://archive.is/6TvDr) [presented](https://web.archive.org/web/20160612192330/https://freedom.press/securedrop-files/HOPEX.pdf) at [**HopeX**](https://archive.is/7QwGZ) in [New York City, July 18-20th](https://archive.is/O9zlW#selection-425.0-425.41). Appelbaum was still in [Berlin](https://archive.is/tLuiW) on the 15th and left for [Amsterdam](https://archive.is/uyBDC#selection-3961.0-3971.24) by the 16th, so it would've had to occur before then.

+ "[West](https://archive.is/TjhUQ)," who was kissed without consent by Appelbaum at a hacker event ([January 27th, 2016](https://archive.is/pEl8w#selection-647.0-649.0)).
+ "[Kiwi](https://archive.is/N10bK)," who initially "joined the digital rights community because of him," was then shamed by Appelbaum in public during the process of building their professional career ([January 28th, 2016](https://archive.is/XYS57#selection-647.0-649.0)).
+ "[Daniel](https://archive.is/R6nDq)," who was dating someone in the Tor community, says Appelbaum violated their privacy and propositioned them for sex ([January 31st, 2016](https://archive.is/hVV6V#selection-645.1-649.0)).
+ "[Forest](https://archive.is/bUw87)," who was propositioned for sex and sexually assaulted while she was sleeping ([February 1st, 2016](https://archive.is/1x40b#selection-647.0-649.0)).
+ "[River](https://archive.is/0jbVl)," romantically involved with him at the time of the incident, was propositioned for group sex and, while intoxicated, sexually assaulted by Appelbaum and subjected to unwanted sexual advances by at least one of his friends at a party ([February 2nd, 2016](https://archive.is/tsKaK#selection-647.0-649.0)).
+ "[Sam](https://archive.is/Tn1fy)," who had a "minor romantic interest" in Appelbaum and was persuaded while intoxicated to get in a bathtub with him at his apartment, followed by verbal abuse when they resisted ([February 3rd, 2016](https://archive.is/EmkCL#selection-645.1-649.0)).
 
There are also complaints about [his name frequently being first on the list of authors](https://archive.is/5Aebu#selection-835.118-835.167) for academic papers; however [the practice of listing authorship alphabetically in research](https://web.archive.org/web/20160314150541/http://www.ams.org/profession/leaders/culture/CultureStatement04.pdf) (at least in the U.S.), especially in the fields of math and computer science, is a very common practice:

> For this reason, mathematicians traditionally list authors on joint papers in alphabetical order. An analysis of journal articles with at least one U.S. based author shows that nearly half were jointly authored. Of these, more than 75% listed the authors in alphabetical order. In pure mathematics, nearly all joint papers (over 90%) list authors alphabetically. 

> These traditions differ from other areas of scholarship, especially those that frequently involve large numbers of researchers working on a single research project. In areas of mathematics that are more closely associated to such areas, the culture and traditions may blend together. 

> While these traditions are well-known to mathematicians, they are often misunderstood by other scholars whose traditions differ. Occasionally, this works against young mathematicians — especially those with names near the end of the alphabet.

Only four people claiming to be victims of Appelbaum have publicly come forward, outside of the allegations of plagiarism by Patterson and Norton. The [first](https://archive.is/bFXW2) was [Nick Farr](https://archive.is/9kjWs), who is one of three to claim authorship of [a story](https://archive.is/vekwa) on the victims website. His entry is now dated [January 25th, 2016](https://archive.is/qBIJV#selection-647.0-649.0). He alleges a span of incidents of verbal harassment which occured during the [**Chaos Communication Congress** event in 2013 (30c3)](https://web.archive.org/web/20160411055714/https://events.ccc.de/congress/2013/wiki/Main_Page), where he was an organizer of the Lightning Talks; Norton [says](https://archive.is/thLMm) she witnessed it. After approving a proposal for a talk which was going to argue that Appelbaum was a US Intelligence Operative, he was chastised first via email and then in person multiple times by both Appelbaum and "important people in the CCC." 

> [Jake demanded all the records I had received from this person. Jake also had the CCC edit the 30c3 wiki database to eliminate any trace of the offending talk.](https://archive.is/bFXW2#selection-357.161-357.319)

Furthermore, he says [a note](https://archive.is/bFXW2#selection-373.84-373.139) was left every night on his hotel room pillow (though he does not know by whom):

> "Don't make us use extreme measures. Hand it all over." 

The second is Alison Macrina, [founder and director the **Library Freedom Project**](https://archive.is/RZunq), who in a [Medium post](https://archive.is/cwU9y) claimed she submitted the "Sam" story, and that she is also [friends](https://archive.is/cwU9y#selection-323.0-323.37) with "River." She tweeted that she had her ["come to Jesus" moment](https://archive.is/dPnG4#selection-4463.21-4463.99) months ago and that she was "[ashamed it took me so long to figure out what was what](https://archive.is/yQRbF#selection-3645.0-3645.59)." Both she and Shepard were still on [friendly terms](https://archive.is/aGNgk) with him as late as [mid-February 2016](https://archive.is/r7jnL), even though the "Sam" story is dated February 3rd. Macrina may have [visited Appelbaum](https://archive.is/orMqQ) in Berlin sometime at the end of 2014 and was also [there](https://archive.is/RaYRk) as a [Tor Project](https://archive.is/x4z7o) [representative](https://archive.is/mSgA1) for the CIJ Symposium in [March](https://archive.is/muAFe). In between she was a fellow presenter with Appelbaum at the last "[State of the Onion](https://archive.is/6unKs)" talk for the **Chaos Communication Congress** in Hamburg, Germany. Her [partner](https://archive.is/kfA1X) Franklin Bynum ([@frabyn](https://twitter.com/frabyn)), a [criminal defense attorney](https://archive.is/Aonrp), [wrote](https://archive.is/NxSJo) "[Decoding Appelbaum](https://archive.is/mQm04)" on June 6th, though neither [disclosed Macrina's involvement](https://archive.is/pL1vi) with the allegations at the time.

The third is Isis Agora Lovecruft ([@isislovecruft](https://twitter.com/isislovecruft)), another [core Tor developer](https://archive.is/yxqlC#selection-395.0-395.15), who [revealed herself](https://archive.is/mmt9h) in a [blog post](https://archive.is/4lywH) as "Forest" on the same day that Macrina claimed to be "Sam." However she ruminates [less about the incident itself](https://archive.is/4lywH#selection-225.73-225.342) and more about when she [tried to resolve the situation six months ago in Valencia](https://archive.is/4lywH#selection-183.0-183.8)...

> Instead, I had planned to gather people for a secret meeting in Valencia, somewhere calm, neutral, and away from events, like on the beach, invite Jake, and have everyone willing who has ever been sexually assaulted, humiliated, harassed, or felt their boundaries disrespected, by him to take turns telling a few sentences about what he did to them and how it made them feel. Then we would tell Jake that, as his friends, we thought this needed to stop, and that we’d either deliver a list of the stories to The Tor Project and other organisations, or make all the stories public, if he refused to hold himself accountable for his actions or his behaviour did not appear to improve. In planning this secret meeting, I tried to determine what would cause Jake to perpetually disrespect other people like this, and if there were any positive things we could do to help him.

... as well as how she wants to pursue "transformative justice" based on her experience dealing with [a different man who was accused of (and later confessed to) the rape of two women](https://archive.is/4lywH#selection-179.153-179.927).

> There are some differences between how Jake is behaving to how the other anarchist I mentioned above was behaving. The other anarchist was willing to engage in the defined process, respectful of his victims’ needs, and eventually sincerely apologetic for his actions.

> I cannot condone his actions; however, I cannot condone violence and threats against Jake. Full stop. That is not productive. If he is further harmed, we never see the end of the wretched [**abused-abuser cycle**](https://web.archive.org/web/20151115231730/http://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/24/science/sad-legacy-of-abuse-the-search-for-remedies.html?).

> [**People who behave as Jake does are sick**](https://web.archive.org/web/20121105192631/http://yas.sagepub.com/content/early/2010/01/07/0044118X09358313.abstract), and they [**need help**](https://web.archive.org/web/20151115231730/http://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/24/science/sad-legacy-of-abuse-the-search-for-remedies.html?). Often, it is because [**they were severely hurt**](https://archive.is/K7vLX) at some point. As the activist adage goes, “*We need to be gentle with one another, so that we can be dangerous together*.”

She has [no forgiveness](https://archive.is/OZjM5) for the women who, in her view, "[weaponized their femininity](https://archive.is/LCCRO)" to sign a letter of solidarity.

The fourth is [Leigh Honeywell](https://archive.is/Cm3R9), a computer and network security professional, who says [she was in an open relationship](https://archive.is/77Sx2) with Appelbaum during 2006-2007.

> In that time we spent together, he violated boundaries I set as though they were a game, particularly at times when I was intoxicated. There were a number of times I felt afraid and violated during interactions with Jacob. Being involved with him was a steady stream of humiliations small and large as he mistreated me in front of others and over-shared about our intimate interactions with friends who were often also professional colleagues.

> For example, on several occasions in professional situations, he told other people that I was good at a particular sex act. On another occasion where my primary romantic partner at the time, [Paul Wouters](https://archive.is/yi79U), was also present, Jacob ignored my use of a safeword when his sexual behavior turned into violent behavior that violated my limits. Paul and I both had to repeatedly tell Jacob to stop, and the experience was profoundly upsetting.

[Violet Blue](https://archive.is/AFFqX), a San Francisco Bay Area freelance journalist, said she's known Appelbaum since 2005 and resisted his sexual advances, as well as [physically intervened](https://archive.is/k3vJE#selection-8053.9-8053.130) when he harassed another girl at a party. She added that these experiences made her wary of "[hero worship in 'hacktivism' circles'](https://archive.is/k3vJE#selection-6669.17-6669.53)." 

[Emerson Tan](https://archive.is/TEIUh), another computer and network security professional, came forward through an interview with both [**Gizmodo**](https://archive.is/K2tdt) and [**The Daily Dot**](https://archive.is/QZIdh). He says Patterson and Shepard were also "eyewitnesses" to the incident, which occurred in the middle of the night (no date specified other than "[it was the day we arrived at CCC"](https://archive.is/QZIdh#selection-1047.91-1047.123)) during the [2015 **Chaos Communication Congress** (32c3)](https://web.archive.org/web/20160607230238/https://events.ccc.de/congress/2015/wiki/Static:Main_Page) in Hamburg, Germany.

> "At about 2 or 3 a.m. in the morning I happen to be talking to [Patterson], [Shepard] and Jacob Appelbaum and a group of other people who have come out of the congress hall into the lobby of the Raddison Blu hotel in Hamburg,” Tan told Gizmodo. “Jake has his hands all over this girl, and she is very obviously not very happy. You know, she’s looking for her bag, they’re having a conversation and she’s looking for her bag she can’t find her bag and she appears to be really quite distressed and Appelbaum forcibly attempts to try and kiss her, grabs her arm and her backside and makes a move for her breasts.

> ... And the other males who we were with were basically just kind of joking amongst themselves and don’t really seem to see anything wrong with it, which is really quite distressing,” Tan said. “So I watched this for about two to three minutes and then I decide to go and do something and just mount a very very subtle intervention. Which is, I go over, I shake Jake’s hand I tell him what a great job he’s doing with the Tor project and the rest of it and that gives the girl roughly the 30 seconds she needs to find her bag without being in an undistracted fashion. She left, and I found her hiding out in the hotel bar later, after Jake had left. She was pretty composed but obviously upset."

In **The Daily Dot** interview he gives far more detail, including what the girl, who Patterson says was "[obviously a little bit inebriated](https://archive.is/QZIdh#selection-1059.80-1059.113)," did [after the incident](https://archive.is/QZIdh#selection-1087.0-1087.256).

> Tan said afterwards he spoke briefly with the woman. He asked if she wanted to file a police report, but she was unwilling. She left the hotel before any of the witnesses learned who she was. The incident was never reported to police or to the Tor Project.

Tan posted the story on his Facebook page, saying that even though he didn't know who the girl was he had submitted it to Steele as part of the investigaton. He also mentions seeing Appelbaum "[trying to take upskirt photos of women" and "making lewd comments and allegations of threesomes with various members of the privacy community](https://archive.is/K2tdt#selection-1379.28-1379.233)." Shephard added that once when Appelbaum was "good drunk" in a bar in July of 2013, he "discussed how he would ‘use my ass’."

![Tan's Facebook posts](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CkX8kzqXEAA5azs.jpg)

However, Tan's story has since been contested. On June 9th, the first alternative story released by [@Ioerror_info](https://archive.is/cFDr1) using [**TwitLonger**](https://archive.is/UX9Jk) claimed that Tan's interpretation of the incident, which occured on the night of December 26th, was wrong. The "girl," allegedly a woman named [Jill Bähring](https://archive.is/nZJGj), had not been subjected to unwanted sexual advances by Appelbaum, and in fact has been "[romantically involved](https://archive.is/UX9Jk#selection-445.1-445.96)" with him. (Her Twitter account was [initially private](https://archive.is/syKKA) but she made it public within a few hours of the statement being published to [authenticate that it was from her](https://archive.is/nZJGj#selection-3499.0-3499.110).) She admits to having temporarily lost her bag and being "[emotionally distressed](https://archive.is/UX9Jk#selection-457.41-457.63)" at the time, but that it was not because of Appelbaum.

> I did indeed look not very happy. I was emotionally distressed at that time and told Jake, one of my close confidants, about my situation. He did have his hands all over me, just as I had my hands all over him. At no point did Jake forcibly attempt to try and kiss me, nor did he grab me in any inappropriate manner.

> While we were talking, I realized that I didn’t have my bag with me, and started looking for it. Anyone who has ever lost sight of their wallet and phone will look “quite distressed” as a consequence. According to Tan and Patterson, none of our friends seemed to see anything wrong with that situation: “And the other males who we were with were basically just kind of joking amongst themselves and don’t really seem to see anything wrong with it, which is really quite distressing” 

> This is true. There was nothing wrong with it. I was among several friends with whom I felt absolutely safe.

She also says that Tan's account of how he approached them wasn't accurate.

> The next day, I wasn’t going to be at the conference, so I didn’t expect to see Jake for a couple of weeks. Jake and I said goodbye to each other in the hotel lobby, and we kissed. But since my friend was waiting for me to leave, I playfully pushed Jake away. At that time, I noticed Emerson Tan for the first time – since he was intervening at that point. He states: “So I watched this for about two to three minutes and then I decide to go and do something and just mount a very very subtle intervention. Which is, I go over, I shake Jake’s hand I tell him what a great job he’s doing with the Tor project and the rest of it and that gives the girl roughly the 30 seconds she needs to find her bag without being in an undistracted fashion.”

> I recall Tan approaching me, asking me if Jacob was harassing me. I said he wasn't. Nevertheless, Tan dragged me away and immediately started talking intensely to Jake. At that point I decided to leave, since my friend was waiting for me. I walked him to his hotel, which was only a couple of blocks away.

She ends the statement by questioning why "[a highly distorted version of my experience](https://archive.is/UX9Jk#selection-509.1-521.68)" had been published in the first place. [Pepijn Le Heux](https://archive.is/h6nay), a Dutch attorney and [Tor advocate](https://archive.is/Q2TTK#selection-507.0-507.24) based in Amsterdam, [retweeted the statement](https://archive.is/9VklJ#selection-1921.0-1921.95) saying "I was at Raddison Blu that night, I know these people & as far as I know this story is accurate." [Yan Zhu](https://archive.is/PTh3G), an [**Electronic Frontier Foundation** Technology Fellow](https://archive.is/Zi0C1) and [former employee at the Tor Project](https://archive.is/PTh3G#selection-1775.0-1775.11), tweeted that she "[was also around that night and didn't do anything because Jill seemed ok. Glad to hear that she was](https://archive.is/1ZMM7)."

**Gizmodo** subsequently [published a new story](https://archive.is/dPAfG) with Jill Bähring's account, though they have yet to add a correction to [the original](https://archive.is/toIZA) despite at least [one request](https://archive.is/mxiMI) to do so; **The Daily Dot** both [added a correction to their original story](https://archive.is/VBMmD#selection-1201.195-1213.57) and published [a new one](https://archive.is/Qdima). Dell Cameron, one of three authors collaborating on coverage at **The Daily Dot**, tweeted [screenshots of emails](https://archive.is/HATig#selection-5799.1-5799.18) to show he was trying to contact Bähring through Tomassini, as she has so far not spoken directly to the press. Tan was also contacted to [comment](https://archive.is/Qdima#selection-987.0-987.146) on the fact that his story had been refuted:

> “This is a situation open to misinterpretation because I do not know what she's thinking,” Tan said. “I'm fully willing to stand up and say that.”

Neither Patterson nor Shepard have revoked their statements or commented on the fact that Bähring refuted their story.

### The Public Reaction

As a [result](https://archive.is/q2zil) of the allegations, Appelbaum has been [removed](https://web.archive.org/web/20160606171748/http://w3.cultdeadcow.com/cms/team_bio.html) from the computer underground group [Cult of the Dead Cow (cDc)](https://web.archive.org/web/20160603052306/http://w3.cultdeadcow.com/cms/about.html), of which he has been [a member since July 2008](https://web.archive.org/web/20160312134611/http://w3.cultdeadcow.com/cms/team_bio.html). Their [official statement](https://archive.is/M1Kgd#selection-67.202-67.401) says that "as we have become aware of the anonymous accusations of sexual assault, as well as the stories told by individuals we know and trust, we've decided to remove Jake from the herd effective immediately." [Oxblood Ruffian](https://archive.is/GxVPv) (pseudonym), who has been a cDc member since April 1996, released their own individual statement on Appelbaum being removed from the group and how he "[used our name to advance his career and gain entrance to circles that might have been closed to him](https://archive.is/0fJev)" without actually contributing anything. He also says "[preying upon the vulnerable is an ungendered pathology](https://archive.is/0fJev#selection-381.355-381.410)" and defends the right of the victims to remain anonymous.

On June 8th, **Freedom of the Press Foundation**'s co-founder and executive director [Trevor Timm](https://archive.is/LRcD9) [announced](https://archive.is/JDoO8) that Appelbaum was also [removed](https://archive.is/Eyzzi) from his [position](https://archive.is/lUiZL#selection-401.0-401.15) on their volunteer technical advisory board.

> In light of the allegations that have been made, Jacob Appelbaum is no longer a member of our outside volunteer technical advisory board. We hope that the serious accusations made against him, and his denial of them, are resolved as fairly and as expeditiously as possible.

**Purism** quietly [removed](https://archive.is/6DS15) him after [a potential customer objected](https://archive.is/FV78W) to Appelbaum still being listed as their [security advisor](https://web.archive.org/web/20160604221755/https://puri.sm/about/).

On June 9th, the **Chaos Computer Club** (CCC) released a "[reminder](https://archive.is/tcgqB)" which did not directly mention Appelbaum or the allegations, but stated that anyone who violates the [ethical principles](https://archive.is/tcgqB#selection-185.0-195.92) of their "galatic organization" is "not welcome."

> In light of recent accusations against a regular visitor and speaker at our events, the Chaos Computer Club re-emphasizes the following: The CCC is, by its charter and by common consent, a galactic organization of all life forms. We are dedicated to providing a safe, comfortable, and supportive experience for everybody attending our events.

> ... [As stated previously](https://archive.is/7OwVs), we do not tolerate life forms who refuse to share this openness and respect towards others: Creatures that are not excellent to others are not welcome.

It is not clear whether this implies Appelbaum is henceforth not welcome or if they intend to investigate the two reports of harassment at their events.

On June 10th, [**Noisebridge**](https://archive.is/ZQZjb), an educational hackerspace in San Francisco, released a PGP-signed [statement](https://archive.is/1Uv7E#selection-51.472-51.573) that Appelbaum was "no longer welcome in our community, either in its physical or online spaces." Appelbaum [co-founded](https://archive.is/O7gQd#selection-2189.162-2193.1) [**Noisebridge**](https://archive.is/EPz1X) with security expert [Mitch Altman](https://archive.is/lIJMY) within the summer and [fall](https://archive.is/3dNbK) of 2007 as an extension of the **Chaos Computer Club**. He is still listed as a [user](https://archive.is/QVDgl) on their '[People](https://archive.is/7MsIa#selection-1213.0-1213.13)' page (though note it is not a membership list).

On June 11th, a group of women consisting of "friends, colleagues, co-workers or partners" of Appelbaum [released](https://archive.is/ochsL) a [statement](https://web.archive.org/web/20160611153425/https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2858953/Statement-Appelbaum-11-06.pdf) criticising the "coordinated and one-sided attack on his character and work."

> We are not apologists for any genuine wrongdoing, and as women working in this community we know that 
there are struggles around sexism. However, simple punitivism is not how the human rights that we all defend 
should be enforced or framed.

> We believe that an open and evidence-based discussion in this situation is necessary to allow our community to 
develop better processes to handle any allegations. Furiously targeting one person without allowing for proper 
fact analysis will never solve the bigger structural problem that has been highlighted. We should use this moment
to grow and make things better, not destroy the movement and create divisions. We need to create a channel for 
discussions on how to make things better. 

The initial signatories of this statement are: [Renata Avila](https://archive.is/PNR07), [Human Rights Lawyer](https://web.archive.org/web/20160319080136/http://webfoundation.org/about/executive-team/renata-avila/); Susan Benn, Artist; [Cathleen Berger](https://archive.is/oEdah), Policy Advisor; [Geraldine de Bastion](https://archive.is/DftjZ), Policy Expert; Annegret Falter, Political Scientist; [Marie Gutbub](https://archive.is/EJlcF), Journalist; [Sarah Harrison](https://web.archive.org/web/20160316133415/https://wikileaks.org/Profile-Sarah-Harrison.html), Journalist; Christy Lange, [Writer](https://archive.is/EgmRA#selection-1777.0-1789.63); [Isik Mater](https://archive.is/QWygD), Infosec Specialist; [Angela Richter](https://archive.is/99Fk6), [Theatre Director](https://web.archive.org/web/20160611160912/http://cultureforum.eu/person/angela-richter/); [Felicity Ruby](https://felicityruby.com/), PhD Candidate; Joana Veron, Lawyer.

They've also [created](https://archive.is/IidiH#selection-3361.0-3391.91) a [website](https://archive.is/KVN4s) with a copy of the statement, inviting others who agree with "[the spirit of this letter](https://archive.is/KVN4s#selection-115.126-115.151)," but may not be colleagues or personal friends of Appelbaum, to sign it by contacting this email: **dueprocess@riseup.net**.

> We therefore invite all others to add their names to this list (using the below contact details) to show their agreement with the spirit of this letter - solidarity with Jake in how this is being handled, on the side of justice for all, and in belief of the need to develop a safe space for accessing the issues to enable building open and transparent guidelines to deal with sexism and gender issues within our infosec and digital rights communities.

They later added a [tweet prompt](https://archive.is/ymmJL):

> In Solidarity with Jacob Appelbaum [@ioerror](https://twitter.com/ioerror) and on the Side of Justice for All. We urge others to add their names to https://ourresponse.org/

[M.C. McGrath](https://archive.is/ke9Yv), founder of the [non-profit **Transparency Toolkit**](https://archive.is/PkZzu), shared a [picture](https://archive.is/apZ0h) of the side of a building which had been graffitied to say "*A rapist lives here | ein Vergewaltiger wohnt hier*!" with an arrow pointing to the middle window. McGrath [said](https://archive.is/YgtDs) this was Appelbaum's house in Berlin, Germany (where [he's lived since 2013](https://archive.is/skoYv#selection-1223.668-1223.844)), but the defacer(s) had [targeted the wrong apartment window](https://archive.is/giZem). He later posted [a second picture](https://archive.is/FDe1v) made in daylight. He reacted by saying "[this is not justice for anyone](https://archive.is/dOA5L#selection-2315.0-2315.34)" and how "the mob going after [@ioerror](https://twitter.com/ioerror) has done more to make me feel unsafe than people in the intelligence community threatening me about my work." The identity of the defacer(s) is unknown.

Though he also did not directly mention Applebaum by name or the allegations, [Daniel J. Bernstein](https://web.archive.org/web/20160607185552/https://twitter.com/hashbreaker), professor of mathematics and computer science at the [**Eindhoven University of Technology**](https://archive.is/7muWD#selection-18219.1-18219.26) where Appelbaum is currently studying, published [a blog post](https://archive.is/NPmvQ) warning of the consequences of skirting due process.

>  Is it really so hard to recognize both of these directions of error? If I prejudge and punish alleged culprits who have not had their day in court, then I will inevitably punish some innocent people: the unfortunate reality is that **many accusations of crimes are false**. If I prejudge and punish accusers who have not had their day in court, then I will inevitably punish some innocent people: the unfortunate reality is that **many accusations of crimes are true**.

> When I say "day in court", what I really mean is **due process**. Due process is a set of ethical principles that civilization has painstakingly developed over several centuries, recognizing that punishment is corrupted by many sources of error on both sides: communication is poor; memories are faulty; sometimes people don't tell the whole truth; sometimes people tell something other than the truth.

> ...  It's really not that hard to stay calm and say something like this: "We weren't there. At this point we can't be sure what happened. Sometimes accusations are true, and sometimes they aren't. It's important for a neutral judge to hear testimony from the accuser and from the accused."

> But not everyone stays calm. Angry people continue to join these mobs. They blog and tweet and report their ill-informed speculations in favor of the accuser or the accused, confident in their own righteousness and blithely unaware of the possibility of being wrong. Ultimately the accused and the accuser are both punished, truth be damned.
