## The History

`Note: This section is for relevant events or statements leading up to Appelbaum's resignation.`

### Early Life

> Highlight of today: Photoshoot at Noisebridge with the talented photographer Peter Yang for Rolling Stone; he's an absolutely awesome guy! -- *Jacob Appelbaum* [@ioerror](https://twitter.com/ioerror) ([June 21st 2010](https://archive.is/F9PBY))

![Appelbaum, from Rolling Stone interview](https://archive.li/9bFTl/632f8e6fa77e5b4906fefd5f8bd5a475b5a9de2b.jpg)

The [**Rolling Stone**](https://archive.is/9bFTl) interview from 2010 is one of the few publicly-available accounts of Jacob Appelbaum's early life. Despite [taking issue](https://archive.is/1JYzf#selection-729.0-743.403) with the "[sensationalist](https://archive.is/taU8z)" [title](https://archive.is/M7X9n) post-publication, as far as I'm aware he has never denied the content.

> Appelbaum's obsession with privacy might be explained by the fact that, for his entire childhood, he had absolutely none of it. "I come from a family of lunatics," he says. "Actual, raving lunatics." His parents, who never married, began a 10-year custody battle before he was even born. He spent the first five years of his life with his mother, whom he says is a paranoid schizophrenic. She insisted that Jake had somehow been molested by his father while he was still in the womb. His aunt took custody of him when he was six; two years later she dropped him off at a Sonoma County children's home. It was there, at age eight, that he hacked his first security system. An older kid taught him how to lift the PIN code from a security keypad: You wipe it clean, and the next time a guard enters the code, you blow chalk on the pad and lift the fingerprints. One night, after everyone had gone to sleep, the boys disabled the system and broke out of the facility. They didn't do anything special — just walked around a softball field across the street for half an hour — but Appelbaum remembers the evening vividly: "It was really nice, for a single moment, to be completely free."

> When he was 10, he was assigned by the courts to live with his father, with whom he had remained close. But his dad soon started using heroin, and Appelbaum spent his teens traveling with his father around Northern California on Greyhound buses, living in Christian group homes and homeless shelters. From time to time, his father would rent a house and turn it into a heroin den, subletting every room to fellow addicts. All the spoons in the kitchen had burn stains. One morning, when Appelbaum went to brush his teeth, he found a woman convulsing in the bathtub with a syringe hanging out of her arm. Another afternoon, when he came home from school, he found a suicide note signed by his father. (Appelbaum saved him from an overdose that day, but his father died several years later under mysterious circumstances.) It got so that he couldn't even sit on a couch for fear that he'd be pierced by a stray needle.

> An outsider in his own home, Appelbaum embraced outsider culture. He haunted the Santa Rosa mall, begging for change. He dressed in drag and "I ♥ Satan" T-shirts, dyed his hair purple, picked fights with Christian fundamentalists and made out with boys in front of school. (Appelbaum identifies himself as "queer," though he refers to at least a dozen female lovers in nearly as many countries.) When a friend's father encouraged his interest in computers and taught him basic programming tools, something opened up for Appelbaum. Programming and hacking allowed him "to feel like the world was not a lost place. The Internet is the only reason I'm alive today."

> At 20, he moved to Oakland and eventually began providing tech security for the Rainforest Action Network and Greenpeace. In 2005, a few months after his father died, he traveled alone to Iraq — crossing the border by foot — and set up satellite Internet connections in Kurdistan. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, he drove to New Orleans, using falsified press documents to get past the National Guard, and set up wireless hot spots in one of the city's poorest neighborhoods to enable refugees to register for housing with FEMA.

> Upon returning home, he started experimenting with the fare cards used by the Bay Area Rapid Transit system and discovered it was possible to rig a card with an unlimited fare. Instead of taking advantage, he alerted BART officials to their vulnerabilities. But during this conversation, Appelbaum learned that BART permanently stored the information encoded on every transit card — the credit-card number used, where and when they were swiped — on a private database. Appelbaum was outraged. "Keeping that information around is irresponsible," he says. "I'm a taxpayer, and I was given no choice how they store that data. It's not democratically decided — it's a bureaucratic directive."

> Given his concerns about privacy, it's easy to see why Appelbaum gravitated toward the Tor Project. He volunteered as a programmer, but it soon became clear that his greatest ability lay in proselytizing: He projects the perfect mix of boosterism and dread. "Jake can do advocacy better than most," says Roger Dingledine, one of Tor's founders. "He says, 'If someone were looking for you, this is what they'd do,' and he shows them. It freaks people out."

### Career

In 2008 [Appelbaum](https://archive.is/GItar) officially [joined](https://web.archive.org/web/20150926185057/https://blog.torproject.org/blog/jacob-and-matt-join-tor-project) the [**The Tor Project**](https://web.archive.org/web/20160810164808/https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en), a [research and development](https://web.archive.org/web/20160305155652/https://www.torproject.org/about/findoc/2013-TorProject-Form990.pdf) [nonprofit based in Cambridge, Massachusetts](https://archive.is/EocOQ), and [Seattle, Washington](https://web.archive.org/web/20160831021252/https://www.torproject.org/about/jobs-grants-officer.html.en). He was part of the translation team, improving documentation for non-technical users, and at the forefront of advocacy and public relations for the Tor network. He also ran "[urras](https://archive.is/gOZ4g#selection-49481.3-49485.0)", [one](https://archive.is/K93V5) of Tor's [directory authorities](https://archive.is/7jFmj#selection-4563.0-4569.364), special servers maintaining a list of all relay nodes (including exits) to help Tor clients find them; there were [eight in 2012](https://archive.is/7jFmj#selection-4567.258-4567.302), [ten in 2014](https://archive.is/HSdAW#selection-1089.35-1091.21), [nine as of today](https://archive.is/uU7Ft). The hostname for the server was [rgnx.net](https://archive.is/fojzV), with the IP address `208.83.223.34`, which was a [target](https://archive.is/jFoiM#selection-9.985-9.998) of the [NSA's XKeyscore (XKS)](https://archive.is/bJxB7) system as revealed in 2014 through [an investigation published by **Das Erste**](https://archive.is/http://daserste.ndr.de/panorama/aktuell/nsa230_*) (a joint production of [Germany's public broadcasting **ARD** consortium](https://web.archive.org/web/20140703202145/http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/07/report-rare-leaked-nsa-source-code-reveals-tor-servers-targeted/)). Prior to [June 2013](https://archive.fo/aimdI#selection-845.257-845.350), he lived in [Seattle](https://web.archive.org/web/20160725223816/https:/twitter.com/ioerror/status/351402088938483712).

> [Obwohl er keinen Hochschulabschluss vorweisen konnte, bekam er 2010 an der Universität Washington einen Job als Forscher und IT-Sicherheitsexperte](https://archive.is/zE8YD#selection-1083.315-1083.462). [Although he possessed no university degree, in 2010 he got a job at the University of Washington as a researcher and IT security expert.] [Doch weil er nicht aufhörte, Julian Assange öffentlich zu unterstützen und vor Bespitzelung zu warnen, verlor er 2012 den Job](https://archive.is/zE8YD#selection-1083.463-1083.589). [But because he didn't stop publicly supporting Julian Assange and warning against spying, he lost the job in 2012.]. 

In June 2012 (before losing his university position), Appelbaum was among [three guests in the eighth episode](https://web.archive.org/web/20150909014714/https://worldtomorrow.wikileaks.org/episode-8.html) of [Assange's televised discussion series *The World Tomorrow*](https://web.archive.org/web/20160522024612/https://worldtomorrow.wikileaks.org/), from which a revised transcript was later published on November 26th as "[Cypherpunks: Freedom and the Future of the Internet](https://web.archive.org/web/20121130062112/http://www.orbooks.com/catalog/cypherpunks)." **Der Spiegel** [reviewed the book](https://web.archive.org/web/20160412142258/http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/netzpolitik/assange-buch-cypherpunks-aluhuete-unter-sich-a-869331.html) as being filled with "Verschwörungstheorien" [conspiracy theories] by "Aluhüte" [tin-foil hats], even though many of the points [would be vindicated a year later](https://web.archive.org/web/20160326230511/http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/the-nsa-uses-powerful-toolbox-in-effort-to-spy-on-global-networks-a-940969-3.html) with Edward Snowden's NSA surveillance leaks.

#### CryptoParty Controversy

On December 27th 2012, founder [Asher Wolf](https://archive.is/v8mHW) ([@Asher_Wolf](https://twitter.com/Asher_Wolf)) [quit as an organizer of **CryptoParty**](https://archive.is/OtPoB), a [grassroots initiative to educate the general public](https://archive.is/CK2kM) on [digital privacy-enhancing tools](https://archive.is/fjKhl), which at the time was [just four months old](https://archive.is/yrSKy). She said "[quitting wasn't easy](https://archive.is/SJLQF)" and cited [a general lack of respect from several people in the movement who took advantage of **CryptoParty**'s decentralized structure](https://archive.is/OxmkN), which may have [put attendees at risk](https://archive.is/nyDQo). One day later she [published](https://archive.is/lIRu1) a [blog post](https://archive.is/fDxKU) with further explanation as to why she left. The 'final straw' was [a series of interactions](https://archive.is/fDxKU#selection-555.0-623.76) surrounding the [**Chaos Communication Congress** in December 2012](https://archive.is/KoKyX) (29c3), particularly involving former [London **CryptoParty**](https://archive.is/CQ8ju#selection-3195.66-3205.23) [organizer](https://archive.is/7Ds0w#selection-5079.1-5089.37) [Samuel Carlisle](https://archive.is/4NWeP) (aka "[Sam the Techie](https://web.archive.org/web/20110716002931/http://samthetechie.com/index.php?id=Contact)"), who allegedly [failed to complete a contract](https://archive.is/oFutb) of [building a website for her after she paid him AUS$700](https://archive.is/Jc7Ct). When he [traveled to Hamburg on December 24th](https://archive.is/ruwwk) for his first Congress, as an [Angel](https://archive.is/w5yXf#selection-887.1-903.11) [volunteer](https://archive.is/XiR8p) and [Lightning Talk](https://youtu.be/eao8yBKHYT8?t=1h29m8s) speaker, she [encouraged others](https://archive.is/L57QI) to [confront him](https://archive.is/Sj67s) on her behalf. As a result of the [attention](https://archive.is/fDxKU#selection-635.0-651.137) on the dispute and [the](https://archive.is/UiFOf) [controversy](https://archive.is/ZW6we) over [someone's](https://archive.is/Eup9E) [retaliation](https://archive.is/MkTzm) for the "Creepercard" ([Red/Yellow card](https://archive.is/qTHN7)) activity, Carlisle claims [he was removed from the volunteer team](https://archive.is/ZdiNq#selection-945.0-945.253). Wolf became a [doxing target](https://archive.is/9eGPN), which she implied was [his fault](https://archive.is/HJOBY). [Web developer](https://archive.is/KEPGx) [Daniel Sieradski](https://archive.is/JSxKP) ([@selfagency](https://archive.is/7eFdH)) helped her [get it back online](https://archive.is/3mKfh) and [finished creating the website](https://archive.is/kEdGU), [free of charge](https://archive.is/fDxKU#selection-571.1-571.98). Despite Carlisle's [public](https://archive.is/3O9Ib) [apology](https://archive.is/ZdiNq), Wolf's positive [reference letter](https://archive.is/uwy3t) for [his MIT application](https://archive.is/ZdiNq#selection-577.1-601.137) (as well as previous [commendation of his work for **CryptoParty**](https://archive.is/OoLXJ#selection-599.1-599.244)), [offers](https://archive.is/MqKBH#selection-5239.1-5239.49) [to](https://archive.is/ugixV) [refund](https://archive.is/BSMV1) via [bank transfer](https://archive.is/UKNGw), and supposedly [more than one person](https://archive.is/lOh7Q#selection-6625.1-6625.101) willing to [act as an intermediary](https://archive.is/zvm4u), the dispute was never resolved. 

Appelbaum was also [mentioned in her blog post](https://archive.is/fDxKU#selection-491.0-519.272) regarding a conversation they'd had on the **Liberation Tech** mailing list in early October, the topic of which was [her technical abilities and willingness to learn](https://mailman.stanford.edu/pipermail/liberationtech/2012-October/005086.html). In response to her assertion that she didn't "[have the right skill set](https://archive.is/xbGvm#selection-577.66-581.28)," he encouraged her not to '[demoralize](https://archive.is/xbGvm#selection-597.49-601.72)' herself, which she misinterpreted as criticism; he [clarified](https://archive.is/r3kjk#selection-659.1-659.622) that [he believed in her willingness to learn](https://archive.is/fDxKU#selection-7119.0-7119.449). She also [criticised his recommendation of PrivateGSM](https://archive.is/fDxKU#selection-523.0-527.31) ([software for making encrypted phone calls](https://archive.is/x05hV)) at the first **CryptoParty** and how he later backed out. In the comments he explained that [he'd had a new device](https://archive.is/fDxKU#selection-6929.0-6929.490) and wasn't able to "[hack it together](https://archive.is/fDxKU#selection-7113.0-7113.466)" in time. The misunderstanding was [resolved](https://archive.is/LhRi2) again and she said his response was "[supportive and constructive](https://archive.is/6pSjn#selection-3575.1-3575.96)." Following the end of the Congress, Appelbaum [organized a crowdfund for Wolf](https://archive.is/nNIfy) through [ChipIn](https://web.archive.org/web/20130104094951/http://supportasherwolf.chipin.com/asherwolf-conflict-resolution) to recover the AUS$700, [half of which he supposedly donated himself](https://archive.is/xTPO2). 

> [I think we should raise $700 for @Asher_Wolf and then try to build consensus on future strategies for conflict resolutions.](https://archive.is/bCeUR) [While raising money to remediate @Asher_Wolf's capital losses doesn't solve all problems, I hope it eases class division pressure.](https://archive.is/0aKZ9) [Lest anyone think otherwise - the cash for @Asher_Wolf is merely to offset her loses and not meant to interrupt the dialog about sexism.](https://archive.is/3kvvk) -- *Jacob Appelbaum* [@ioerror](https://twitter.com/ioerror) (January 1st - 2nd, 2013)

[Within a day](https://archive.is/e2YK7) the fundraiser [surpassed $500](https://archive.is/OYrtM) and soon [ended with a total of $885](https://archive.is/EQyrc) from [about thirty donors](https://archive.is/dqBkZ), at which point [Appelbaum closed the campaign](https://archive.is/59Ls3) at [Wolf's request](https://archive.is/tQfEE). Responding to [Carlisle's worry that the campaign insinuated his guilt](https://archive.is/azEC6#selection-3937.1-3937.125), Appelbaum said it was not an "[absolute condemnation](https://archive.is/WpBln#selection-3941.61-3941.82)" of him and made "[no judgement](https://archive.is/azEC6#selection-4305.8-4305.19)" on the matter because he "[didn't know the details](https://archive.is/3O9Ib#selection-3755.108-3755.127)" and hoped this would "[make peace possible](https://archive.is/azEC6#selection-4315.39-4315.58)." Wolf voiced displeasure that [Appelbaum](https://archive.is/f5ZjF#selection-6267.1-6277.41) [hadn't consulted with her prior to launching the campaign](https://archive.is/f5ZjF#selection-9869.2-9869.96), that there wasn't a "[strategy](https://archive.is/f5ZjF#selection-10567.12-10567.117)," and she [felt pressured](https://archive.is/f5ZjF#selection-11589.1-11589.59) to [express gratitude](https://archive.is/umKVV#selection-6615.1-6615.108). She was [unable to refuse donations](https://archive.is/2p1Jw#selection-8251.1-8251.74) and claimed [**PayPal** froze her account](https://archive.is/2p1Jw#selection-9991.1-9991.118).

> [If by "screwed up" you mean someone decided to earnestly attempt to fix a problem without discussing it with me](https://archive.is/cru0j) [and now I can't access my PayPal account as a result and I can't issue refunds because the account is frozen, well yes.](https://archive.is/2U36r) [It was all very well-meaning 'tho, we all know that.](https://archive.is/l9WD0) -- *Asher Wolf* [@Asher_Wolf](https://twitter.com/Asher_Wolf) (January 3rd, 2013)

Appelbaum said his effort to reimburse Wolf "[wasn't trying to make her whole. The goal was to return the amount of money she invested until the dispute can be solved](https://archive.is/wiber#selection-4231.1-4231.124)."

During the [OHM](https://web.archive.org/web/20160313213308/https://ohm2013.org/site/) ("[Observe. Make. Hack.](https://web.archive.org/web/20151012105257/https:/twitter.com/ohm2013)") hacker camping festival in the [Netherlands](https://web.archive.org/web/20160723093620/https:/twitter.com/Asher_Wolf/status/361818080852185088), Wolf [personally confronted](https://web.archive.org/web/20160723090042/https:/twitter.com/Asher_Wolf/status/362996336485867521) [Carlisle](https://web.archive.org/web/20160723090905/https:/twitter.com/samthetechie/status/362418803528839168) and again [told him to pay her back](https://web.archive.org/web/20160723092302/https:/twitter.com/Asher_Wolf/status/362851225177305088) the [AUS$700](https://web.archive.org/web/20160723093218/https:/twitter.com/Asher_Wolf/status/362857221903761408).

#### Len Sassaman and Plagiarism Allegations

Amidst the [discussion about the crowdfund for Wolf](https://archive.is/Sb4s0), technology researcher and writer [Meredith Patterson](https://web.archive.org/web/20160325052441/http://www.thesmartpolitenerd.com/aboutme.html) ([@maradydd](https://archive.is/1FYbO)) surfaced allegations of plagiarism against Appelbaum. She hasn't publicly specified what research was plagiarized, only saying later in [October 2014 that a talk of his](https://archive.is/9cBQN#selection-6183.58-6193.0) for the ['*Nothing to Hide*' **Chaos Communication Congress** in 2008](https://archive.is/eOZVC) (25c3) was stolen from her, her [now deceased husband](https://archive.is/pZy3O) [Len Sassaman](https://archive.is/2S6xg), and [American security researcher](https://archive.is/RBkNS) [Dan Kaminsky](https://archive.is/tFs3a) ([@dakami](https://twitter.com/dakami)).

The "research" allegedly stolen was [oral discussions](https://archive.is/qDCjS#selection-3131.7-3131.98) between the three [during the previous Congress (24c3)](https://archive.is/ADGlp#selection-3157.0-3187.16) in December [2007](https://archive.is/xuuCG#selection-3877.99-3877.131). [Appelbaum's talks for 25c3](https://archive.is/ZegZe) were '[Building An International Movement: hackerspaces.org](https://archive.is/mULaP)', '[Advanced Memory Forensics: The Cold Boot Attacks](https://archive.is/GqBjE)' (solo), and '[MD5 Considered Harmful Today](https://archive.is/9koyI).' The talk Patterson was referring to is the last one, a proof-of-concept execution [based on](https://web.archive.org/web/20160730084027/https:/twitter.com/ioerror/status/302275901104738305) [the research of Marc Stevens, et al.](https://web.archive.org/web/20160310181406/http://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/ChosenPrefixCollisions/) regarding [chosen-prefix collisions](https://web.archive.org/web/20151009031105/http://marc-stevens.nl/research/papers/EC07-SLdW.pdf) (February 2007). Stevens, et al. were not only the original authors of the research but [Appelbaum's co-speakers for the CCC talk](https://web.archive.org/web/20160729053707/https://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/rogue-ca/), who she has not yet accused of plagiarism despite the fact that they would be implicated with Appelbaum in her claim. According to [**Subgraph** Chief Technical Officer](https://web.archive.org/web/20160406073537/https://subgraph.com/about-us/index.en.html) [Bruce Leidl](https://web.archive.org/web/20160730105006/https://twitter.com/bleidl), there was [a competition among security researchers to implement and present the attack](https://web.archive.org/web/20160730105120/https:/twitter.com/gbelljnr/status/519224834610704384) of the original paper but "[no person who actually worked on the project has any grievance with Jake](https://web.archive.org/web/20160730111010/https:/twitter.com/bleidl/status/519233392043634688)."

> [If you compare names, you'll see these are the same people in both instances](https://web.archive.org/web/20160730110239/https:/twitter.com/bleidl/status/519227844782985218). The difference is that in the second instance, the attack from the paper is implemented and practically demonstrated. After the first paper was published, many security researchers, including myself had the idea of actually implementing the attack. Kaminsky and friends also thought about doing this it seems and had started working on it (when?) with the goal of presenting at a conference and being recognised for basically the work of these famous cryptographers.

> ... [So Kaminsky claims that he told Jake that they were working on it at some conference, which Jake doesn't even remember](https://web.archive.org/web/20160730110712/https:/twitter.com/bleidl/status/519230833493020672). I believe this since I've always seen Jake demonstrate nothing but good faith in such situations and there isn't much. -- *Bruce Leidl* [@bleidl](https://twitter.com/bleidl) (October 6th, 2014)

Patterson said [Appelbaum apologized to her](https://archive.is/xuuCG) about their "differences" during [Sassaman's wake](https://archive.is/uZ6WI) at the [DNA Lounge](https://archive.is/l48by) and she not only [acknowledged Appelbaum's apology](https://archive.is/e8CIg#selection-6649.1-6649.118) but admitted that [Sassaman forgave him](https://archive.is/SJZFw#selection-6695.56-6695.71) and [she unexpectedly backtracked on her acceptance](https://archive.is/Sb4s0#selection-7721.1-7721.113) due to [unresolved anger](https://archive.is/Sb4s0#selection-8431.1-8431.85); she also apologized for her "[entirely](https://archive.is/Sb4s0#selection-9141.105-9141.113) [passive-aggressive](https://archive.is/Hit0Z#selection-6667.5-6667.54)" attempt a [resolving](https://archive.is/e8CIg#selection-7033.49-7033.103) it by [writing negatively about him in **Hacker News**](https://archive.is/Sb4s0#selection-6637.1-6637.99). In addition to [frequent friendly discussions on usability, security, and legal issues](https://archive.is/LCTtn) (including [offering research help](https://archive.is/r0otF#selection-1727.1-1737.58)), Sassaman in fact had [expressed](https://archive.is/nlHIq) [support](https://archive.is/HTNQr) [for Appelbaum](https://archive.is/0IaBJ) [in 2011](https://archive.is/ysFlR) after he was repeatedly detained and interrogated [by US CBP at the airport](https://archive.is/oKzf1).

She said Appelbaum was "[playing fast and loose with attribution](https://archive.is/XXF0F#selection-7097.16-7097.55)" and that his apology to Sassaman had been [dishonest](https://archive.is/6auiA#selection-5939.28-5939.116) and [manipulative](https://archive.is/XXF0F#selection-9609.1-9609.61) because Len's "[forgiveness was contingent upon Jake keeping his nose squeaky clean with regards to attribution. He hasn't](https://archive.is/knbDT#selection-5671.1-5681.98)." She did not specify what the new allegations of plagiarism were.

She also accused Appelbaum of lying about the date of his apology to Sassaman: Appelbaum said [they "made up" at **Noisebridge**](https://archive.is/28kIq#selection-4949.1-4949.84), whereas Patterson was only aware of a [reconciliation](https://archive.is/r61AJ#selection-4949.1-4949.126) through [IM](https://archive.is/knbDT#selection-4937.1-4937.126) weeks before his [suicide](https://archive.is/fxXV) on [July](https://archive.is/tHqj6) [3rd](https://archive.is/YO5eK) after [battling chronic depression and degenerative pain](https://archive.is/KoCKm).

#### Online Harassment of the Tor Project

Over a span of several months prior to the [**Chaos Communication Congress**](https://archive.is/FQsDm) (31c3) in December 2014, [core Tor developer](https://archive.is/Q2TTK#selection-739.0-739.25) [Andrea Shepard](https://archive.is/yF1cg) was the target of repeated online harassment. On Thanksgiving Day, she [doxxed the leading troll Jeremy Becker](https://web.archive.org/web/20160902180938/https://motherboard.vice.com/read/that-time-a-tor-developer-doxxed-a-troll) (aka '[JbJabroni10](https://web.archive.org/web/20141017222250/https://twitter.com/JbJabroni10)').

> Finally, in retaliation, Shepard published a blog post that [revealed](https://web.archive.org/web/20160327134457/http://charon.persephoneslair.org/~andrea/pandorasts/jeremy_becker/) JbJabroni’s real name: [Jeremy Becker](https://web.archive.org/web/20160327134457/http://charon.persephoneslair.org/~andrea/pandorasts/jeremy_becker/), a pharmacist who lives with his parents in New Jersey. Becker has since deleted all his accounts.

> It’s unclear whether the doxxing will put a stop to Becker’s behavior. Shepard told Motherboard she hasn't been contacted by any of Becker's known accounts, but has no way of being sure if he’s not still harassing her under a new name as “he was part of a larger mob of deranged Pando followers.”

> ... In an email, Shepard admits doxxing to stop harassment is “not a reliable solution because a smarter harasser will always manage to conceal himself, but I'll take what I can get in the moment right now.”

While she is said to have received the brunt of the harassment, in the [blog post identifying Becker](https://archive.is/AaYqn) she [details several other people, including Appelbaum](https://archive.is/AaYqn#selection-1467.0-1467.867), connected to the **Tor Project** who were similarly harassed. A few months earlier, [Appelbaum](https://web.archive.org/web/20160915184252/https:/twitter.com/ioerror/status/540956918832201728) had been interviewed by [**Exberliner Magazine**](https://web.archive.org/web/20160915184134/https:/twitter.com/exberlinermag/status/514041191349125120) about [offline harassment](https://web.archive.org/web/20160427194354/http://www.exberliner.com/features/people/jacob-appelbaum-on-the-usa-and-nsa/) he had also experienced from the U.S. government.

On December 1st, she brought attention to tweets from someone who, like [Becker](https://web.archive.org/web/20140607100128/https://twitter.com/JbJabroni10/status/474595443373273088), was [criticising her support of Auernheimer](https://web.archive.org/web/20160730063403/https:/twitter.com/RedKahina/status/539541609390411776). She responded by saying the person was "dangerously unhinged" and that the tweets demonstrated "[her inability to comprehend that talking to someone doesn't imply agreement, while typical of her purge-happy political persuasion](https://archive.is/1C8M0#selection-4027.1-4027.133)." When asked why she gave 'Weev' "[the time of day](https://archive.is/1C8M0#selection-4437.1-4437.106)" based on her experience with harassment, she said "[he's never been an ass to me personally and I seriously dislike purge dynamics](https://web.archive.org/web/20160730041421/https:/twitter.com/puellavulnerata/status/539535501083291648)." Appelbaum, whom Auernheimer had repeatedly called a "[plagiarizing snitch](https://web.archive.org/web/20160730050304/https:/twitter.com/rabite/status/619910511401041921)/ [fraud](https://web.archive.org/web/20160730053516/https:/twitter.com/rabite/status/302506374204620800)/ [degenerate](https://web.archive.org/web/20160730050915/https:/twitter.com/ACKFlags/status/613481330010144768)" and "[filthy Jew](https://web.archive.org/web/20160730053516/https:/twitter.com/rabite/status/302506374204620800)," asked whether it mattered to her that "[he has done awful stuff directly to me](https://web.archive.org/web/20160730041125/https:/twitter.com/ioerror/status/539538444113162240)." Auernheimer [took the opportunity](https://web.archive.org/web/20160730050802/https:/twitter.com/ioerror/status/539551292419739649) to bring up the allegations regarding Sassaman, a move which [Patterson supported](https://web.archive.org/web/20160730051353/https:/twitter.com/rabite/status/539551640903487488):

On December 30th at the CCC, Appelbaum and then [**Tor Project** director](https://archive.is/WTt5r#selection-247.0-247.54) [Roger Dingledine](https://twitter.com/RogerDingledine) presented the "[State of the Onion](https://media.ccc.de/v/31c3_-_6251_-_en_-_saal_1_-_201412301400_-_state_of_the_onion_-_jacob_-_arma)," an annual update on developments at the **Tor Project**. [Three minutes in](https://youtu.be/pRrFWwA-47U?t=3m22s), Appelbaum started speaking about the "[sustained campaign of online harassment](https://archive.is/iyJKZ)" which had been [directed](https://archive.is/ljqM4) at Shepard "for the past several months." 

> APPELBAUM: It is the case that there's a person in our community, and many persons in our community, that have come under attack and have been deeply harassed. We think that sucks and we don't like that. Even though we promote anonymity without any question, that is no backdoors ever (and we'll get back to that in a minute), it is the case that we really want to promote being excellent to each other (in the spirit of Noisebridge). [...] It isn't the case that we're saying you shouldn't have the right to say things, but we are saying "get the fuck out of our community" if you're going to be abusive to women.

> And you'll note that I used the word "fuck" to say it; I'm sorry about that because the point is we all make mistakes and we want to make sure that, while it's true that we have transgressions, we want to make sure that we can find a place of reconciliation and we can work towards conflict resolution. It's important at the same time to recognize that there are people whose real lives are harmed by harassment online. In this case, one of the people is in this audience and I hope that they won't mind be named, but we want to give her a shout-out and say that we stand behind her a hundred percent.

> DINGLEDINE: One of our developers on core Tor, Andrea, has been harassed on Twitter and elsewhere, really a lot more than should happen to anybody. 

> [...] She's not just being attacked because she happens to be there, she's being attacked because they're trying to attack the Tor Project and all the other people in Tor; so yes, she may be the focus of some of the attacks but we, the rest of the Tor community, the rest of the security community, need to stand up and take on some of this burden of communicating, interacting and talk about these issues. We can't just leave it to her to defend herself.

As Appelbaum followed up with, [the](https://archive.is/Da9Mu) [harassment](https://archive.is/3yp8b) seemed to [center](https://archive.fo/AsEnA) overall on the controversial topic of [Tor's creation](https://archive.is/QNyQ7) by the [U.S. Naval Research Laboratory](https://web.archive.org/web/20160324221848/http://www.onion-router.net/Publications/JCS-1997.pdf), their continued [funding from the U.S. government](https://archive.is/OQlhR), and use by the [intelligence](https://archive.fo/WR9X1#selection-3865.118-3865.311) [sector](https://archive.fo/WR9X1#selection-3919.0-3919.424), a debate which has been raging since the software became more widely used by the public. Becker's supporters [cited that debate as justification for his actions](https://web.archive.org/web/20160606213216/https://cienflamingos.wordpress.com/2014/11/30/privacy-advocates-to-critics-shut-the-fuck-up-or-well-dox-you/), that he "[badgered high-status, key people](https://archive.fo/3r4v0#selection-331.29-331.61)" (in this case, Tor developers and spokespersons) "[for answers to questions he considered important](https://archive.fo/3r4v0#selection-331.62-331.110)."

According to national security researcher and journalist [Alexa O'Brien](https://archive.is/nHFae), who claims to have spoken with Appelbaum on the subject at the event, he was "sympathetic to [retribution] against the troll."

#### Suspension from the Tor Project

Based on a [letter](https://archive.is/5zlA0) cited by [**Golem.de**](https://archive.is/J7rxB), leaked through the anonymous blog site [**FearlessBlogging.com**](https://archive.is/aVULh), **Tor Project**'s then [human relations manager](https://archive.is/Q2TTK#selection-515.0-515.12) [Tom Leckrone](https://archive.is/rYKWV) (who still [contributes to the mailing list](https://archive.is/Of5TC)) wrote to Appelbaum on March 18th 2015 that he was "expected to engage... on performance and conduct issues" as part of a Performance Improvement Plan following "an unpaid suspension for a period of ten business days" from March 20th to March 30th. The suspension was due to incidents which took place on March 3rd and 6th during a [core Tor team company meeting](https://archive.is/DrGwH) in [Valencia, Spain](https://blog.patternsinthevoid.net/valencia-spain.html), during which [one of the topics was reducing government funding](https://web.archive.org/web/20160731234252/http://www.dailydot.com/layer8/tor-funding-us-government/). (This was also the week of the [**Circumvention Tech Festival**](https://archive.is/9klki), during which Appelbaum [tweeted](https://archive.is/ooFR7) they needed help identifying a [suspicious GPS tracking device](https://archive.is/tbdfC) found on an [attendee's](https://archive.is/KDYAy) vehicle.) The letter states:

> As you know, a community member advanced a complaint that included two separate instances. One of the instances involved a provocative conversation on the afternoon of March 6th. The person to whom you were speaking was not offended, but the provocative conversation could be overheard by others and created an unwelcoming environment.

> The other incident raises more serious concerns regarding Tor Project’s obligation to ensure a safe and comfortable work environment, especially as regards an environment that is unwelcoming or hostile to protected classes of community members. In this case, you made statements that implied that new community members were recruited in a sexually charged manner. This was made during the course of a Tor Project-sanctioned work session which you took part in leading. The very statement that the inception of a working relationship was in any way influenced by sexual conduct or even innuendo is offensive, especially in an environment where Tor Project is actively working to ensure that all community members are able to engage and advance themselves based on their skills and willingness to contribute rather than other attributes.

> ... In the repartee that followed, you expressly stated that the offensive sexualized recruitment “strategy” had “worked” with the complainant. This statement created an inappropriate and unwelcome environment for the complainant, and, indeed, any bystander who overheard this statement would be likely to perceive that the work environment at Tor Project was not welcoming and supportive of merit-based work.

He also warned Appelbaum that he should resign if he didn't want to follow the terms of suspension or the Performance Improvement Plan; even if he did comply, he could have his employment terminated if "[further performance or conduct issues ensue](https://archive.is/5zlA0#selection-315.0-315.402)." It may be relevant that Appelbaum was [told to contact then Executive Director](https://archive.is/5zlA0#selection-323.0-323.81) [Andrew](https://web.archive.org/web/20160727170502/https://twitter.com/AndrewLewman) [Lewman](https://web.archive.org/web/20160727170852/http://www.lewman.is/#twitter), who had been with the **Tor Project** [since 2009](https://archive.is/XVYVt#selection-115.15-115.102) and then chose to [leave](https://archive.is/uC18m) less than a month after this letter was sent (the position was [filled](https://archive.is/cKnF2) by Dingledine in [May of that year](https://web.archive.org/web/20160805021103/https://twitter.com/torproject/status/594160457599950848)). The stated reason was that he left to work with "an Internet services company," which is rather euphemistic considering it was actually [two](https://archive.is/OZkQV), [**Inman Technology**](https://archive.is/DRYbZ#selection-669.50-669.232) and [**Norse Corporation**](https://archive.is/LdGRr), both of which are information technology companies [with ties to the intelligence sector](https://archive.is/OZkQV#selection-1921.2-1927.78) (which was probably [negatively received](https://archive.is/52OED)). When Lewman was contacted to comment on his alleged mishandling of the situation as Executive Director, he said he was "[unable to comment on internal HR and legal matters during my time at The Tor Project, Inc.](https://web.archive.org/web/20160731182019/http://www.dailydot.com/layer8/jacob-appelbaum-tor-project-sexual-misconduct/)"

![Roger Dingledine, source: https://web.archive.org/web/20160805015805/https:/twitter.com/torproject/status/671821341658509312](https://web.archive.org/web/20160805015805im_/https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CVLJ8y9XIAAYuWb.jpg)

According to [**Buzzfeed**](https://archive.is/wvbwZ) (who spoke with yet unnamed sources) the "community member" who advanced the complaint which precipitated this letter was then [Development Director Karen Reilly](https://archive.is/WTt5r#selection-673.0-673.34) (oddly not listed under past contributors, while [Lewman](https://archive.is/RPj8I#selection-411.0-411.40) is; this is [the last archived page](https://web.archive.org/web/20150416074507/https://www.torproject.org/about/corepeople.html.en) she appears in).

> She told [the board of the Tor Project] about Appelbaum’s public and false claims that he had sex with a specific member of the Tor community — something multiple sources have told BuzzFeed News Appelbaum has “done to too many people to count.” And she told them of darker allegations against him that had come up after a group of disgusted Tor community members gathered to share stories.

> ...According to sources, Appelbaum’s behavior had been the talk of the conference. Reilly had separately approached Lewman, Dingledine, Mathewson, and Seltzer in Valencia and told them of the harassment.

> At dinner, the conversation turned to Appelbaum after Gardner, not yet a Tor employee, broached the subject. According to a source with knowledge of the dinner, Gardner said her friends had been asking her why she was working with an organization that employs a rapist. After that, Reilly “rehashed everything.”

> ... Following the dinner, according to sources, Tor conducted a human resources inquiry into the matter.

Like Appelbaum, Reilly was also given a ten-day suspension, but for "[spreading rumors about the **Tor Project**](https://archive.is/wvbwZ#selection-2959.100-2959.217)." It is not stated what kind of rumours, about whom, or by what [medium](https://archive.is/qMQU7). Unlike Appelbaum, she didn't take the offer and left; no mention was made of her departure in **Tor Project** blog announcements. As late as [October 2014](https://archive.is/w6DEK), Reilly had defended Tor for dealing effectively with these kinds of issues. A year later to the day, she wrote a [blog post](https://archive.is/61e8T) reflecting that she now thought otherwise:

> If I had the power to remove the sexual harassers and misogynists from our midst, don’t you think I would have done so already? The problem is that I don’t have the power. If I worked for the sort of industry that removed awful men, I would have the power to remove awful men. If I say something, I’m the hysterical bitch who just wants to create drama. If I oppose an abuser openly, I become a target along with the people I care about.

**Golem.de** claims they have confirmed the authenticity of the letter ("... [die Echtheit der Mail bestätigt](https://archive.is/J7rxB#selection-547.109-547.219)"), though the submitter remains anonymous and the **Tor Project** has [not confirmed it](https://archive.is/vM92Z#selection-4191.1-4201.77). **Ars Technica** Senior Business Editor and journalist [Cyrus Farivar](https://web.archive.org/web/20160602030108/http://arstechnica.com/author/cyrus-farivar/) has [also published](https://archive.is/vVDQC) a copy of the [internal email](https://web.archive.org/web/20160610033307/https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2858268/Appelbaum-Wurde-Im-Jahr-2015-Ausgesetzt.pdf), which he said was [sent to him anonymously](https://archive.is/vM92Z#selection-3259.8-3259.19).

Between the 17th and the 18th (when Leckrone sent the suspension email), Reilly tweeted what is possibly a reference to the "[canary in the coal mine](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/canary_in_a_coal_mine#English)" allusion:

> Canary status: dead. -- *Karen Reilly* [@akareilly](https://twitter.com/akareilly) ([March 17th, 2015](https://web.archive.org/web/20160731214426/https:/twitter.com/akareilly/status/577828583948816384))

Appelbaum also tweeted:

> I wonder what the best defenses are for JTRIG-ish psyops? Just buckle in and move slow? Refuse to be split? Refuse to be atomized? ([March 17th, 2015](https://archive.is/nW5Is))

![JTRIG chart](https://archive.li/kDzXc/b2a926bb585face74776c6ccd5343e831cb4dc43.png)

"[JTRIG](https://archive.is/zhdGz)" is the acronym for a unit of GCHQ, the **Joint Threat Research Intelligence Group**, which uses psychological manipulation tactics to infiltrate and destroy activist groups by understanding, shaping, and controlling how discourse unfolds. The **Human Science Operations Cell** (HSOC) is a division of GCHQ which focuses on online human intelligence. Documents outlining their purpose and methods were among those [leaked by Edward Snowden](https://archive.is/5v3pP) (with which [Appelbaum was closely involved](https://archive.is/skoYv)) and subsequently published through media outlets with access to the archives. In [February 2014](https://archive.is/kDzXc), [co-founding journalist and constitutional lawyer](https://archive.fo/tw8CD) [Glenn Greenwald](https://web.archive.org/web/20160905184955/https:/twitter.com/ggreenwald) released a series of documents on JTRIG, including "[The Art of Deception: Training for a New Generation of Online Covert Operations](https://theintercept.com/document/2014/02/24/art-deception-training-new-generation-online-covert-operations/)," in which they outline their goals to create "cyber magicians" who can manipulate targets at individual, group, and global levels using social psychology.

> Among the core self-identified purposes of JTRIG are two tactics: **(1)** to inject all sorts of false material onto the internet in order to destroy the reputation of its targets; and **(2)** to use social sciences and other techniques to manipulate online discourse and activism to generate outcomes it considers desirable. To see how extremist these programs are, just consider the tactics they boast of using to achieve those ends: “false flag operations” (posting material to the internet and falsely attributing it to someone else), fake victim blog posts (pretending to be a victim of the individual whose reputation they want to destroy), and posting “negative information” on various forums. 

#### Freedom of Information (FOI) Lawsuit

In June 2015, **The Intercept** [published](https://web.archive.org/web/20160313032127/https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2108000-unsealed-documents-google-appelbaum-wikileaks-case.html) [court records](https://web.archive.org/web/20160729161017/https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2108000/unsealed-documents-google-appelbaum-wikileaks-case.pdf) sent to Appelbaum in May after [the government had agreed to unseal them on April 1st](https://archive.is/9972D#selection-429.0-429.77). The documents detailed how the U.S. Justice Department forced **Google** into turning over "[more than one year's worth of data from the Gmail account of Jacob Appelbaum](https://archive.is/9972D#selection-359.72-359.148)," including a gag ( a "perpetual nondisclosure provision" as defined by [18 U.S. Code § 2703](https://web.archive.org/web/20160721170712/https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2703)) to prevent **Google** "[from notifying Appelbaum that his records had been provided to the government](https://archive.is/9972D#selection-363.116-363.194)."

> [According to the unsealed documents, the Justice Department first sought details from Google about a Gmail account operated by Appelbaum in January 2011, triggering a three-month dispute between the government and the tech giant. Government investigators demanded metadata records from the account showing email addresses of those with whom Appelbaum had corresponded between the period of November 2009 and early 2011; they also wanted to obtain information showing the unique IP addresses of the computers he had used to log in to the account.](https://archive.is/9972D#selection-371.0-371.545)

**Google** argued that providing such records not only violated Appelbaum's Fourth Amendment rights but his [First Amendment rights as a journalist](https://archive.is/9972D#selection-381.196-381.544) (see [pgs 10-11 under "The Order May Raise Significant Free Speech and Other Privilege Issues" of Attachment A](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2108000-unsealed-documents-google-appelbaum-wikileaks-case.html#document/p11)).

> To the extent that the Gmail user [redacted] is a journalist or engaged in other constitutionally protected activities, the user may wish to assert First Amendment rights or any applicable journalist, academic or other privileges or defenses to which the user is entitled. Google is not properly positioned to do so on behalf of users.

The Justice Department argued that [Appelbaum had “no reasonable expectation of privacy” over his email records](https://archive.is/9972D#selection-375.47-375.122), where the Order "simply requires disclosure of 'non-content' information" (see [pg 8 under "The Order is Constitutional" of Attachment B](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2108000-unsealed-documents-google-appelbaum-wikileaks-case.html#document/p43)), and also [didn't acknowledge him as being a journalist](https://archive.is/9972D#selection-387.199-387.253). They considered the nondisclosure provision to be necessary because "unsealing and permitting disclosure of the Twitter Order has already seriously jeopardized the investigation" (see [pgs 3-4 under "Argument"](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2108000-unsealed-documents-google-appelbaum-wikileaks-case.html#document/p38) or [pgs 11-16 of Attachment B](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2108000-unsealed-documents-google-appelbaum-wikileaks-case.html#document/p46)), referring to the [public controversy following their other Order to Twitter for the same data](https://archive.is/9972D#selection-395.0-402.0) (see [pgs 5-7 under "Procedural Posture" of Attachment A](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2108000-unsealed-documents-google-appelbaum-wikileaks-case.html#document/p6)).

> The Twitter Order was issued on December 14, 2010 and relates to the ongoing Wikileaks investigation, which is obviously an issue of great public interest. The Twitter Order demanded the production of subscriber information and certain records and other non-content information for a number of Twitter account holders from November 1, 2009 to the present, including an account with the user name [redacted]. It also contained a non-disclosure provision. The grand jury investigation underlying the Twitter Order was widely reported in the *New York Times* and other media outlets around the time the Twitter Order was issued. Indeed, prior to issuance of the order, the Attorney General had acknowledged that the government was actively investigating Wikileaks.

> ... On January 4, 2011, the day after the government agreed to unseal the Twitter Order, it procured from this Court the Order in this matter, which is substantially identical to the Twitter Order and compels Google to produce the idential information as the Twitter Order for the Google Gmail account [redacted]. The perpetual nondisclosure provision in the order is identical to the Twitter Order nondisclosure provision.

`Artist rendering of Judge Buchanan, who authorized the Twitter Order (here presiding on a different case).`

The redacted article which the government provided as evidence of the investigation having been "seriously jeopardized" (see ["Government Exhibit 1" of Attachment B](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2108000-unsealed-documents-google-appelbaum-wikileaks-case.html#document/p55)) was Greenwald's **Salon** piece: "[DOJ Subpoenas Twitter Records of Several WikiLeaks Volunteers](https://web.archive.org/web/20160724012722/http://www.salon.com/2011/01/08/twitter_2/)." The redactions from the article as presented by the government included the words "Wikileaks" and "Icelandic Parliament member," as well as the names of [Birgitta Jónsdóttir](https://web.archive.org/web/20160729190202/https://twitter.com/birgittaj), Appelbaum, [Rop Gonggrijp](https://web.archive.org/web/20160729190417/https:/twitter.com/rop_g), Assange, Bradley Manning (who now goes by 'Chelsea' Manning) and [presiding](https://web.archive.org/web/20160729174530/http://www.plainsite.org/dockets/mnb4xp5j/virginia-eastern-district-court/in-re-2703d-order-10gj3793/) federal [Magistrate judge](https://web.archive.org/web/20160729174722/http://www.plainsite.org/judges/virginia-eastern-district-court/theresa-carroll-buchanan/) [Theresa Buchanan](https://web.archive.org/web/20160729023758/http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/locations/ale.htm).

(Note: Greenwald incorrectly describes the court order as a "subpoena" in the title and several times in his article; it is a "D" order, [not a subpoena](https://web.archive.org/web/20110813230012/http://paranoia.dubfire.net/2011/01/thoughts-on-doj-wikileakstwitter-court.html), since it was signed by Judge Buchanan.)

According to the final attachment, "on July 29th, 2011, Google provided notice of the Section 2703(d) Order to the subscriber following expiration of the non-disclosure period" of ninety days; however this authorization only pertained to its *existence*, as the contents remained sealed until April 2015 (see [pgs 1-2 under "Background" of Attachment O](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2108000-unsealed-documents-google-appelbaum-wikileaks-case.html#document/p300)).

The [first amended complaint](https://web.archive.org/web/20160722221927/https://cryptome.org/2016/06/leopold-obrien-006.pdf) was filed on August 9th.

#### Visit to North Korea

> If someone asked you on a date to go on a tour of North Korea, would you go? Asking for a friend. 

> -- *Jacob Appelbaum* [@ioerror](https://twitter.com/ioerror) ([January 21st, 2016](https://web.archive.org/web/20160731154549/https://twitter.com/ioerror/status/690351870288748544))

In [early April 2016](https://archive.is/UNxr6), Appelbaum visited North Korea for [seven days](https://archive.is/qIWWz#selection-1113.0-1113.43) as part of a guided tour group of nine other Americans with the [Korean International Travel Company](https://archive.is/qIWWz#selection-1077.69-1077.105), supposedly after [receiving offers](https://archive.is/fXuKk) sometime in [January](https://archive.is/z4M1R). Though he never publicly announced he was going, he can be seen in the group pictures from a [personal essay](https://archive.is/qIWWz) written by [**PBS Newshour** producer](https://archive.is/4msEB) [Hannah Yi](https://archive.is/Qop6H), as well as the [tour video](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https://vimeo.com/172360421) uploaded [anonymously](https://archive.is/uy8bI) to **Vimeo** between the 26th and 27th of June (Vimeo later took it down, but I had saved an .mp4 copy and [re-uploaded it here](http://vimple.co/04506a053f124483b8fb05ed73899f19)). Other than Appelbaum making an appearance, what is shown in the video matches pictures shared by Yi in the essay, such as [the soccer game at the Rungrado 1st of May stadium in Pyongyang](https://archive.is/qIWWz#selection-915.55-1193.98) and the [bronze statues at the Mansudae Grand Monument](https://archive.is/qIWWz#selection-915.55-1165.108). It has been alleged that this trip [may have threatened the **Tor Project**'s funding](https://archive.is/OIK0V#selection-215.2475-215.2578).

#### Denunciation of Establishment Media

On April 13th, Appelbaum [delivered](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJValv4YQcY) a [speech](https://archive.is/FrTlr) he self-described as "journalistic suicide" at the [**Logan Center for Investigative Journalism** (CIJ) Symposium](https://archive.is/ZgsyC) (where he is an [advisor](https://archive.is/iOm5e#selection-311.0-311.15)) in Berlin, Germany. During the speech he outlined how he and other investigative journalists had been betrayed by establishment journalists, particularly at **The Guardian** which he called the "[shittiest publication in the English language](https://archive.is/FrTlr#selection-1729.0-1743.1)," to the point where their lives were at risk.

> Some of you have written things in papers, for example, were you call me, or Julian Assange, or Sarah Harrison, 'internet activists'. To you that have done that, I think that you do not understand potentially what you do and, in that case, I have some forgiveness for you. But for those of you that do, I understand that you think me your political enemy and I take that up quite seriously, and I will win. So, with that in mind, I don't call you a 'grammar activist'.

> But I would say that it is important that if we have 'disclosure activists' in the audience, I think it's important to consider, for example, that when we have bylines together in papers and later you call me an 'internet activist', it's important to remember you should probably have disclosed in your article where you called me an 'internet activist' that, actually, we were co-authors on, for example, the equivalent of the German Pulitzer Prize, or something similar to that.

> To call me a 'political activist' is to consciously put me outside of the political tent of privilege and to say: go ahead, instead of being under *journalism law*, you're under *terrorism law*.

#### Visit to Cuba

> What is the best way to fly to Havana, Cuba from Germany for [@cubaconference](https://twitter.com/cubaconference) without touching FVEY countries? Asking for a friend.

> -- *Jacob Appelbaum* [@ioerror](https://twitter.com/ioerror) ([December 12th, 2015](https://web.archive.org/web/20160906012023/https:/twitter.com/ioerror/status/675697215088828416))

At the end of [April](https://web.archive.org/web/20160906012925/https:/twitter.com/ioerror/status/675693785003786240), Appelbaum went on a [two-week](https://web.archive.org/web/20160906012543/https:/twitter.com/ioerror/status/727206162748346368) trip to attend the three-day [*Conferencia Internacional de Software Libre*](https://web.archive.org/web/20160906014307/https://www.cubaconf.org/location/) ([International Free Software Conference](https://web.archive.org/web/20160906012427/https://twitter.com/cubaconference)) at the [*Colegio Universitario San Geronimo*](https://web.archive.org/web/20160906021932/https:/twitter.com/cubaconference/status/724059032059695104) in Havana, Cuba. The purpose of the conference was to gather free software enthusiasts who "[normally are prevented to participate not only by financial reasons but also by denying the entry visa](https://web.archive.org/web/20160906015111/https://www.cubaconf.org/)," and discuss how free software can help those in developing countries. On the [first day](https://web.archive.org/web/20160906010030/https://www.cubaconf.org/schedule/day-1/), [Appelbaum](https://web.archive.org/web/20160906020821/https://twitter.com/jacobonajera/status/729333197033619456) gave a midday [talk](https://web.archive.org/web/20160906014650/https:/twitter.com/cubaconference/status/719130667473334272) titled "[Anonymity and You - A Discussion about the Tor Network](https://web.archive.org/web/20160906014945/https://contributions.cubaconf.org/contributions/cdcbfeac02cc2bbf8ef70bdb146fa554.html)."

## The Resignation

On the 24th of May 2016, one day before Appelbaum would resign, Shepard tweeted a [commitment hash](https://web.archive.org/web/20160603213504/https://twitter.com/puellavulnerata/status/735230102154448898) (i.e. [making a statement of secret value which can be authentically revealed in the future](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Commitment_scheme)).

The **Eindhoven Institute for the Protection of Systems and Information** (Ei/PSI) published the schedule of speakers for their "[Security in Times of Surveillance](https://web.archive.org/web/20160506055357/http://www.win.tue.nl/eipsi/surveillance.html)" event on May 26th. Sometime between [the 24th and the 26th](https://archive.is/vhO8h#selection-2149.0-2177.6), Appelbaum's talk "Beyond End-to-End Encryption" was [cancelled](https://archive.is/JzF0j#selection-443.0-449.15), the reason only noted as "sickness." [Dingledine](https://web.archive.org/web/20160820222617/https:/twitter.com/RogerDingledine/status/733104755900305408), who had a talk on [Tor onion services](https://web.archive.org/web/20160607101201/https://www.win.tue.nl/eipsi/surveillance.html), still participated in the event.

![Shari Steele, source: https://web.archive.org/web/20160805014545/https:/twitter.com/torproject/status/675314646782451712](https://web.archive.org/web/20160805014545im_/https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CV8zF66U4AAzCh1.jpg)

On May 27th, [former **Electronic Frontier Foundation** Executive Director](https://web.archive.org/web/20160629062403/https://www.eff.org/about/staff/shari-steele) [Shari Steele](https://archive.is/B8rRs) (who became [Executive Director](https://archive.is/Q2TTK#selection-767.0-767.32) of the **Tor Project** in [December 2015](https://web.archive.org/web/20160805014545/https:/twitter.com/torproject/status/675314646782451712) to "[solve their operational challenges](https://web.archive.org/web/20160909153913/http://www.dailydot.com/layer8/shari-steele-tor-project-eff/)") reportedly [requested that Appelbaum sign a resignation agreement](https://web.archive.org/web/20160608122942/https://cryptome.org/2016/06/tor-appelbaum-separation.pdf) in which he would promise "[mutual non-disparagement](https://archive.is/FP1GE)," including giving up the right to sue the **Tor Project**. According to the attached explanation by [**Cryptome.org**](https://cryptome.org/), Appelbaum refused to sign the agreement and it was never executed.

### Removal from Core Tor

On June 2nd, 2016, Steele posted a ["transition" update](https://web.archive.org/web/20160603213021/https://blog.torproject.org/blog/jacob-appelbaum-leaves-tor-project) on the organization's blog:

> Long time digital advocate, security researcher, and developer Jacob Appelbaum stepped down from his position at The Tor Project on May 25, 2016.

Within the same day that Steele announced Appelbaum's departure, Shepard [revealed the hash](https://archive.is/V0hZw#selection-26133.0-26133.78):

> Precommitment revealed: sha256("It seems one rapist is one rapist too many\n") ([June 2nd, 2016](https://web.archive.org/web/20160609070443/https:/twitter.com/puellavulnerata/status/738581432893743104))

(To verify this yourself using OpenSSL, type `echo It seems one rapist is one rapist too many | openssl sha256`, the output of which should be `(stdin)= bfb9a7c833a5fc8f5a938d816b1bbc4acaa06519fdb1af4c8632719596807dac`).

Shortly before the transition update was published, Dingledine allegedly [sent out an email to the Tor-internal mailing list](https://web.archive.org/web/20160628002000/https://cryptome.org/2016/06/dingledine-appelbaum-16-0602.pdf) with more detail about Appelbaum's resignation (which was [originally leaked on June 5th](https://archive.is/u6iOS) and [republished](https://archive.is/bylE6) and mirrored by [**Cryptome.org**](https://archive.is/isP0T#selection-269.0-268.1) on [June 27th](https://archive.is/4vY5N)). The email outlined who would be the [points of contact](https://archive.is/bylE6#selection-215.5302-215.5597), reassured them they were still working on [drafting documents for company and community policy](https://archive.is/bylE6#selection-215.5599-215.6201), that [Tor-the-company would survive this](https://archive.is/bylE6#selection-215.6203-215.6565), and urged them to "[be mindful](https://archive.is/bylE6#selection-215.7704-215.7737)" about how they talked to the public or engaged in "[twitterwar](https://archive.is/bylE6#selection-215.7820-215.7830)." No one from Tor has yet confirmed whether the email is authentic.

A few days later, Appelbaum's name was [removed from the list](https://archive.is/yxqlC) of core **Tor Project** employees and volunteers, then added to the [list of past contributors](https://web.archive.org/web/20160823164626/https://www.torproject.org/about/contributors.html.en). Someone also [quietly deleted](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/what-tor-supporter-looks-%E2%80%93-jacob-appelbaum) [blog posts on Appelbaum](https://web.archive.org/web/20160304052552/https://blog.torproject.org/blog/what-tor-supporter-looks-%E2%80%93-jacob-appelbaum), at least one of which was [later restored](https://web.archive.org/web/20160724235806/https://blog.torproject.org/blog/what-tor-supporter-looks-%E2%80%93-jacob-appelbaum).

However, he still appeared to [have control over his Tor directory authority](https://archive.is/K93V5). On July 1st, Dingledine emailed a plan to drop 'urras', a process which requires [at least five](https://archive.is/LzgfS#selection-83.785-83.895) of the [nine other directory authorities](https://archive.is/7lJ4c) to agree in consensus, including [at least one of three DAs which votes on recommended versions](https://archive.is/LzgfS#selection-83.1243-83.1354): '[moria1](https://archive.is/V0WKc)' controlled by Dingledine, '[gabelmoo](https://archive.is/EaZdS)' controlled by [developer](https://archive.is/yxqlC#selection-367.0-367.25) [Sebastian Hahn](https://archive.is/HESIE) (shown to be [targeted by the NSA's XKeyscore program](https://archive.is/gU88G#selection-1699.0-1705.154) in [2014](https://archive.is/Xx4hr)), and '[tor26](https://archive.is/OiSgs)' controlled by [sysadmin and developer](https://archive.is/yxqlC#selection-647.0-647.39) [Peter Palfrader](https://archive.is/UwKjE). On July 5th, the [process](https://archive.is/qBZO4) for [removing 'urras'](https://archive.is/uU7Ft) was complete.

### Patterson Denounces "Gross Disservice to Tor Community"

As people responded to the news about Appelbaum as well as these mysterious tweets, it became clear that they were connected after Patterson tweeted about [the lack of explanation in Steele's announcement](https://web.archive.org/web/20160731170352/https://twitter.com/maradydd/status/738801590333624320).

> [blog.torproject.org/blog/jacob-appelbaum-leaves-tor-project](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/jacob-appelbaum-leaves-tor-project) [is a gross disservice to the Tor community. People deserve to know why Tor evicted its resident sociopath.](https://archive.is/1FYbO#selection-5199.0-5211.107) [You don't just kick sociopaths down the road and play like you've done the necessary. That's extending their social license to operate.](https://archive.is/1FYbO#selection-4819.0-4819.135) [Tor had the chance to nip this in the bud back when Jake was just a plagiarist. They ignored it, and he graduated to sexual assault](https://archive.is/1FYbO#selection-4449.0-4449.132)... [Jake finally raped enough people that Tor as an organisation couldn't ignore it anymore](Jake finally raped enough people that Tor as an organisation couldn't ignore it anymore.). -- *Meredith Patterson* [@maradydd](https://twitter.com/maradydd) ([June 3rd, 2016](https://web.archive.org/web/20160731170744/https://twitter.com/maradydd/status/738803204960309248))

As background to her assertion that he "graduated [from plagiarist] to sexual assault," it would be relevant to note that Patterson and Appelbaum have a history of being involved in plagiarism disputes (see '[Len Sassaman and Plagiarism Allegations](https://github.com/Enegnei/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor/blob/master/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor.md#len-sassaman-and-plagiarism-allegations)'), where Appelbaum was the accused, extending back prior to the passing of her husband Len Sassaman in 2011 (mentioned in [this thread](https://twitter.com/ioerror/status/302261054497509376) as "Len"). She recently [tweeted her account](https://archive.is/xuuCG) of an interaction with Appelbaum which followed that particular dispute, and [then said](https://archive.is/laWvR) that "Jake hasn't apologised to any of his assault/harassment victims that I know of either. And to everyone else trying to make hay out of that distinction, hairsplitting isn't a good look on you." Auernheimer replied to Patterson's thread, saying "[plagiarism is a more serious allegation than rape to me personally](https://web.archive.org/web/20160730050805/https:/twitter.com/rabite/status/739820793681588224)... [The bug Jake stole from Len was awesome. Once in a lifetime kind of stuff. Irreplaceable.](https://web.archive.org/web/20160730045417/https:/twitter.com/rabite/status/739820216226615296)" American journalist [Quinn Norton](https://archive.is/GIttq) later also [claimed involvement in plagiarism disputes](https://archive.is/5Sywt) with Appelbuam. They have yet to directly specify, or present evidence of, what work he plagiarised. In Patterson's case she probably won't ever do so, since she's [already told Leidl](https://archive.is/q4PbR) (who [challenged how she defined 'plagiarism'](https://archive.is/qDCjS#selection-3485.1-3485.118)) that "[when research that gets stolen was only communicated about orally, there is no paper trail](https://archive.is/qDCjS#selection-3131.7-3131.98)." [Kaminsky](https://archive.is/AK00O), one of the alleged victims, was also [unwilling to provide details](https://archive.is/qkoTS#selection-4929.1-4929.97). [**Cryptocat**](https://web.archive.org/web/20160614234138/https://crypto.cat/mission.html) developer [Nadim Kobeissi](https://archive.is/CIb0I) has also [argued with Appelbaum](https://archive.is/ub4CH) in the past with regards to [attribution rights](https://archive.is/VlKC6), but outside of [one tweet](https://archive.is/GW6T0) on the subject has stayed out of the debate because he "[thought a bit more about things and decided I had better things to emotionally invest myself in than an angry riot](https://archive.is/tPnaQ)." 

The majority of those who responded were [shocked and/or asked for more information](https://web.archive.org/web/20160604033907/https://twitter.com/maradydd/status/738801590333624320), both about the rape allegations and the circumstances of Appelbaum stepping down, which the **Tor Project** only said was a "[personnel matter](https://archive.fo/Qs6va#selection-1737.10-1737.79)." According to **Süddeutsche Zeitung**, a Munich daily newspaper, the Berlin Public Prosecution Office is not aware of any claims to date against Appelbaum ("[Die Berliner Staatsanwaltschaft ermittelt nach eigenen Angaben bislang nicht gegen Jacob Appelbaum](https://archive.is/5D41r#selection-2189.168-2189.267)").

On June 4th, Steele [released a longer public statement](https://archive.is/uOTpp) about the situation. Though it did confirm that the allegations led to Appelbaum stepping down, it did not reveal who or how many victims there allegedly are, only that the matter was being investigated with the help of "a legal firm that specializes in employment issues including sexual misconduct."

> Over the past several days, a number of people have made serious, public allegations of sexual mistreatment by former Tor Project employee Jacob Appelbaum. These types of allegations were not entirely new to everybody at Tor; they were consistent with rumors some of us had been hearing for some time. That said, the most recent allegations are much more serious and concrete than anything we had heard previously. We are deeply troubled by these accounts.

> We do not know exactly what happened here. We don't have all the facts, and we are undertaking several actions to determine them as best as possible. We're also not an investigatory body, and we are uncomfortable making judgments about people's private behaviors.

> That said, after we talked with some of the complainants, and after extensive internal deliberation and discussion, Jacob stepped down from his position as an employee of The Tor Project.

Farivar said he had a "[story forthcoming](https://archive.is/aGbcD)" on this event. He has since published two, the [first](https://web.archive.org/web/20160605131228/http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/06/tor-developer-jacob-appelbaum-quits-after-sexual-mistreatment-allegations/) summarizing the allegations and Tor's response, the [second](https://archive.is/v9tPj) on Appelbaum's response. A [screenshot of an email](https://archive.is/No8pV) sent to him indicates, like the blog post, that they're investigating the allegations.

`Note: Though surname & email address are blacked out, 'Kate' is likely Communications Director Kate Krauss.`

### Appelbaum Denounces Allegations

Appelbaum's last message, prior to these allegations going public, was a tweet on the day he supposedly left the **Tor Project**: "[Changing of the guards](https://web.archive.org/web/20160605180001/https://twitter.com/ioerror/status/736259103790632960)." He remained silent until June 6th, when he [issued a statement](https://archive.is/YZ2co) using [TwitLonger](https://archive.is/I7Zhd), both to say that the allegations against him where "entirely false" and the "vicious and spurious" way they were delivered has made him "prepared to use legal channels, if necessary, to defend my reputation from these libelous accusations."

![Appelbaum's statement on TwitLonger](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CkQaB9mXAAAEGCz.jpg)

An international film publicist, [Claudia Tomassini](https://archive.is/eHxMD), told **WIRED** that Appelbaum's "[legal team is working on an injunction against these monstrous and factually incorrect accusations](https://archive.is/pCaSd#selection-1511.239-1511.444)." According to **The Daily Dot** she "[walked back that statement](https://archive.is/QZIdh#selection-1039.170-1039.350)," instead [saying](https://archive.is/Qdima#selection-1115.0-1123.169) he “deserves as fair a hearing as anybody who comes forward with grievances against him.” She also clarified that Appelbaum was not her client; her involvement with him arose out of one of her [media publicity projects](https://archive.is/XbC4k), [Laura Poitras](https://archive.is/eyCfz)' [*Risk*](https://archive.is/BZUi0), a documentary film on the cypherpunk underground that [features Appelbaum](http://www.claudiatomassini.com/uploads/media/RISK_POITRAS_PRESSNOTES.pdf), which premiered on [May 19th](https://web.archive.org/web/20160905191928/https:/twitter.com/suigenerisjen/status/733451151501316096) at the directors' fortnight of [*Festival de Cannes*](https://archive.is/Vuoij) ([Cannes International Film Festival](https://archive.is/4U3ZF)).

On August 10th, [reporter and author](https://web.archive.org/web/20160810140332/http://www.n-fuchs.de/leben.htm) [Christian Fuchs](https://web.archive.org/web/20160810140056/https:/twitter.com/ChristianFuchs_) of the Hamburg-based German national newspaper [**DIE ZEIT**](https://web.archive.org/web/20160810135203/https:/twitter.com/DIEZEIT) [published](https://web.archive.org/web/20160810132848/https:/twitter.com/ChristianFuchs_/status/763294821096296449) (in [English](https://web.archive.org/web/20160810134918/http://www.zeit.de/kultur/2016-08/jacob-appelbaum-rape-allegations-contradictions) and [German](https://web.archive.org/web/20160810093742/http://www.zeit.de/kultur/2016-08/jacob-appelbaum-vergewaltigung-vorwuerfe-zweifel)) an excerpt of [a weeks-long investigation](https://web.archive.org/web/20160810174133/https:/twitter.com/kappuchino/status/763414767054782465), made [available for purchase online](https://web.archive.org/web/20160810194058/https://www.ikiosk.de/shop/epaper/die-zeit.html) and [scheduled for print publication the next day](https://web.archive.org/web/20160810184217/https:/twitter.com/kappuchino/status/763372864804388864). Data journalist [Lars Weisbrod](https://web.archive.org/web/20160811170320/https://twitter.com/larsweisbrod), of the [Henri-Nannen-Schule](https://web.archive.org/web/20160811171455/http://www.henri-nannen-schule.de/die-schule/absolventen/der-35-lehrgang/) for [journalism](https://web.archive.org/web/20160811171335/https://www.torial.com/en/lars.weisbrod/about), is also a [co-author](https://web.archive.org/web/20160813110103/https:/twitter.com/ChristianFuchs_/status/764100061785628672). It was based on interviews with Appelbaum, eight witnesses, and the alleged victim "River" (see '[Victims](https://github.com/Enegnei/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor/blob/master/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor.md#victims)'). This was the first time Appelbaum had spoken to the press about the allegations.

> [He told **ZEIT** that as a person in a leadership role, he made many mistakes and hurt people, and he is willing to accept responsibility for this. Nevertheless, he said, the statements from "River" were completely fabricated. "At no point did I have sex with someone who was unconscious.

**DIE ZEIT** noted again that "[there have been no reports of charges by victims or investigations by police or public prosecutors against Appelbaum](https://archive.is/gbw90#selection-927.187-927.304)," and [Appelbaum hadn't gone to police either](https://archive.is/FjOk0#selection-1255.148-1255.285). [Sebastian Mondial](https://web.archive.org/web/20160810151016/https://twitter.com/kappuchino), a [**DIE ZEIT** investigative researcher](https://archive.is/1FA9p) and [data journalist](https://web.archive.org/web/20160810160132/https://www.icij.org/journalists/sebastian-mondial), tweeted about his [involvement in the investigation](https://web.archive.org/web/20160810151836/https://twitter.com/kappuchino/status/763332467382247424). Apparently addressing the claim that Appelbaum chose them first, he said:

On [August 12th](https://web.archive.org/web/20160812132547/https:/twitter.com/zeitonline_kul/status/764075068120936449), the [full](https://web.archive.org/web/20160812130118/http://www.zeit.de/2016/34/jacob-appelbaum-sexueller-missbrauch-vorwuerfe) [four](https://web.archive.org/web/20160812130229/http://www.zeit.de/2016/34/jacob-appelbaum-sexueller-missbrauch-vorwuerfe/seite-2)-[page](https://web.archive.org/web/20160812130325/http://www.zeit.de/2016/34/jacob-appelbaum-sexueller-missbrauch-vorwuerfe/seite-3) [investigation](https://web.archive.org/web/20160814005150/http://www.zeit.de/2016/34/jacob-appelbaum-sexueller-missbrauch-vorwuerfe/seite-4) was published online; an [English translation](https://web.archive.org/web/20160813160106/http://www.zeit.de/kultur/2016-08/jacob-appelbaum-rape-sexual-abuse-allegations/komplettansicht) was [published](https://web.archive.org/web/20160813163131/https:/twitter.com/zeitonline/status/764425332711690240) the next day. Its main focus is the rape allegation by "River," but they also briefly cover the two incidents from the last **Chaos Communication Congress** which were refuted (see witnesses '[Emerson Tan, Patterson, Shepard, and Hirsch](https://github.com/Enegnei/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor/blob/master/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor.md#emerson-tan-patterson-shepard-and-hirsch)'), including [Lovecruft](https://archive.is/FjOk0#selection-1169.96-1169.300)'s alleged [fabrication and subsequent removal](https://archive.is/FjOk0#selection-1133.0-1147.188) of the story behind "Alice", and then supposedly [unmentioned crucial details](https://archive.is/FjOk0#selection-1179.0-1185.281) regarding Macrina's allegation of sexual assault (see '[Alison Macrina](https://github.com/Enegnei/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor/blob/master/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor.md#alison-macrina)').

(Note: The German version of the story describes Appelbaum as the former lead developer of Tor ("[der führende Entwickler des Tor-Projekts](https://archive.is/VNuvO#selection-1021.166-1023.16)"). While he *was* considered a [developer](https://archive.is/XvBxg#selection-143.17-143.25) and the leading [advocate](https://archive.is/XvBxg#selection-143.17-143.25) / "icon" ("[die Galionsfigur](https://archive.is/VNuvO#selection-1025.18-1025.34)") responsible for the public image ("[für die Außendarstellung zuständig](https://archive.is/2Lhvm#selection-987.86-987.125)") of the **Tor Project**, it should be clear that he was not in a core Tor lead developer position.)

### Replacement of Tor Project Board Members

On July 13th, the **Tor Project** [announced](https://archive.is/IU6S7) that it would be [replacing all seven members on the board of directors](https://archive.is/L1iIh) "in keeping with its commitment to the best possible health of the organization." The statement was [written by the outgoing board](https://archive.is/vVYc0#selection-75.2-75.56) and [posted as a press release](https://archive.is/vVYc0#selection-75.57-75.133) by [Krauss](https://archive.is/yxqlC#selection-471.0-471.57). Though Dingledine and Mathewson stepped down from the board, they will "[continue in their roles as co-founders of the Tor Project, leading Tor's technical research and development](https://archive.is/L1iIh#selection-143.0-143.404)."

> [In an interview, Ms. Steele said the board moves were intended to “bring in a strong, leadership-oriented board with more experience leading a strong and sustainable organization.” Recruiting new members, she said, had not been a challenge.](https://archive.is/XsOmO#selection-2115.0-2115.240)

> [“All of them had been watching what was going on with Tor and were committed and enthusiastic about growing this into a stronger and sustainable organization,” she said.](https://archive.is/XsOmO#selection-2119.0-2119.169)

> [The departing directors are Meredith Hoban Dunn, Ian Goldberg, Julius Mittenzwei, Rabbi Rob Thomas, Wendy Seltzer and two of Tor’s co-founders, Roger Dingledine and Nick Mathewson. Mr. Dingledine and Mr. Mathewson will remain as leaders of Tor’s technical research and development.](https://archive.is/XsOmO#selection-2123.0-2123.281)

[Six](https://web.archive.org/web/20160726015109/https://www.torproject.org/about/board.html.en) of the [original seven positions](https://web.archive.org/web/20160714031156/https://www.torproject.org/about/board.html.en) were filled and some were renamed; Casper Bowden's position as an 'in memoriam' director was also removed. [Computer scientist](https://web.archive.org/web/20160305103600/http://www.crypto.com/research.html) [Matt Blaze](https://web.archive.org/web/20160726020855/https:/twitter.com/mattblaze) has taken the position of [Board Chair](https://web.archive.org/web/20160726021200/https:/twitter.com/torproject/status/753692643679358976); EFF's Cindy Cohn as [Board Treasurer](https://web.archive.org/web/20160726021357/https:/twitter.com/torproject/status/753693618100015104); [McGill University anthropologist](https://archive.is/bGBJx) [Gabriella Coleman](https://archive.is/jmDj5) as [Board Clerk](https://web.archive.org/web/20160726021617/https://twitter.com/torproject/status/753699047123279872); privacy advocate [Linus Nordberg](https://web.archive.org/web/20160726021844/https:/twitter.com/torproject/status/753691463523840000) (a [Tor developer](https://archive.is/yxqlC#selection-627.0-627.35) who also runs the Swedish directory authority '[maatuska](https://archive.is/3eHMh#selection-121.15-121.29)'), human rights data analyst [Megan Price](https://twitter.com/torproject/status/753696657355616256), and security technologist [Bruce Schneier](https://web.archive.org/web/20160726022442/https://twitter.com/torproject/status/753695953240981505) as directors. Neither the [old board of directors](https://archive.is/HxbPp) nor the new have publicly commented on the investigation outside of praising the **Tor Project**'s response.

### Tor Project Concludes Investigation

On July 25th, the **Tor Project** [announced via **Gizmodo** that their two-month "external investigation" had concluded](https://web.archive.org/web/20160725231550/http://gizmodo.com/tor-concludes-applebaum-investigation-will-release-new-1784235523?rev=1469454977173). Steele did not give details on what the findings or conclusions were, only saying that they would "[release the general findings of the investigation as well as new guidelines regarding sexual harassment](https://archive.is/4JWMx#selection-1393.80-1393.183)" "[exclusively to *The New York Times* later this week](https://archive.is/4JWMx#selection-1549.52-1555.17)."

> Steele told Gizmodo that the Tor Project has no plans to bring any of the sexual assault claims to law enforcement, but said that she can’t speak for the individual victims. The external probe, conducted by a lawyer who specializes in sexual assault investigations, interviewed more than six people who claimed to be victims of Appelbaum’s abuse or to have witnessed it. According to one woman interviewed as part of the probe, the investigator conducted multiple interviews over a period of two months.

> “We were especially looking at the accusations against Jacob Appelbaum and also looking to see if there were any broader long term implications for the broader community,” Steele told Gizmodo. She said the investigation also looked at whether the Tor Project held any liability.

**Gizmodo** claims to have also interviewed an anonymous source "[with knowledge of the investigation](https://archive.is/4JWMx#selection-1543.123-1543.158)."

> People inside the Tor Project are still deliberating what Tor’s statement regarding the report will say, though one source with knowledge of the investigation said that the report will not use the word “rape.”

On [July 27th](https://web.archive.org/web/20160727185617/https:/twitter.com/torproject/status/758326879673724928), Steele [announced directly from the Tor blog](https://archive.is/lkywt) that the investigation had concluded. Due to the "[sensitive](https://archive.is/lkywt#selection-121.0-121.36)" nature of the information, she did not disclose who was involved in the investigation or clarify what "unwanted sexually aggressive behavior" was found to have occurred.

> "... [A number of people have come forward with first-person accounts and other information. The Tor Project hired a professional investigator, and she interviewed many individuals to determine the facts concerning the allegations. The investigator worked closely with me and our attorneys, helping us to understand the overall factual picture as it emerged](https://archive.is/lkywt#selection-117.12-117.364).

> ... [The investigation is now complete. Many people inside and outside the Tor Project have reported incidents of being humiliated, intimidated, bullied and frightened by Jacob, and several experienced unwanted sexually aggressive behavior from him. Some of those incidents have been shared publicly, and some have not.](https://archive.is/lkywt#selection-129.0-129.314) 

Steele also claims that they found "two additional people as having engaged in inappropriate conduct, and they are no longer involved with the Tor Project." She did not identify these individuals or what their "inappropriate conduct" consisted of, only telling **The New York Times** that they "[had also been involved in the incidents](https://archive.is/X6lAf#selection-2157.88-2157.264)" and "[we won’t tolerate this behavior anymore](https://archive.is/X6lAf#selection-2243.44-2243.83)." [Krauss was contacted directly on the subject by **Ars Technica**](https://web.archive.org/web/20160727172736/http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/07/tor-inquiry-many-people-reported-being-humiliated-by-appelbaum/) but she also [refused to give their names](https://archive.is/aLPTA#selection-2163.0-2169.80). **The Daily Dot** claims to have spoken with anonymous sources who say the individuals, both male, left "[more than a month ago](https://archive.is/AqZfG#selection-1267.277-1267.298)" and were not accused of assault.

> [Sources with knowledge of the investigation told the Daily Dot that the project cut ties with the two men, only one of whom was an actual project member, more than a month ago. The two U.S.-based developers, unidentified by the Tor Project, are not accused of assault, the sources said.](https://archive.is/AqZfG#selection-1267.123-1267.410)

According to **BuzzFeed**, the two men will be [reintegrated](https://archive.is/MDNhc#selection-3149.0-3149.166) into the Tor community by **Tor Project**'s new Community Team and Council; Macrina, who [leads the Community Team and is a member of the Community Council](https://archive.is/MDNhc#selection-3143.107-3143.507), has been [recused from this effort](https://archive.is/MDNhc#selection-3155.0-3155.198) after [two core Tor members](https://archive.is/MDNhc#selection-3149.167-3155.198) pointed out the conflict of interest (see '[Alison Macrina](https://github.com/Enegnei/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor/blob/master/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor.md#alison-macrina)'). She claimed that because the Community Team is unpaid, they [do not have access to the investigation results](https://archive.is/MDNhc#selection-3155.199-3155.363).

[In response to the news](https://web.archive.org/web/20160727184404/https:/twitter.com/akareilly), Reilly [referenced what Mathewson allegedly said to her](https://archive.is/wvbwZ#selection-2905.0-2905.175) at the Tor developer meeting in Valencia.

Other than repeating what Steele said in the blog post, she claims to have also spoken with an anonymous source with regards to Appelbaum's absence in what turned out to be a one-sided investigation:

> [Mr. Appelbaum was preparing to address the results of the investigation after the release of Tor’s statement, said a person who spoke on the condition of anonymity.](https://archive.is/X6lAf#selection-2163.0-2163.164)

> ... [Mr. Appelbaum did not participate in the Tor investigation, citing concerns with the way the findings would be communicated and the security of the investigation, according to the person who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Mr. Appelbaum had asked that Tor’s investigators speak with him in person or through encrypted means and declined to take part when those requests were not met, this person said.](https://archive.is/X6lAf#selection-2207.0-2207.406)

The **Tor Project** later tweeted about the use of encryption during the investigation. It is unclear if this is a refutation of Perlroth's article or if these options were only offered to alleged victims and witnesses, but not Appelbaum.

![Steele uses euphemism for rape in interview](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CoaDwQpWcAESVHd.jpg)

Following the publication of the article, Perlroth said Steele used "[a euphemism for 'rape'](https://web.archive.org/web/20160728110305/https://twitter.com/nicoleperlroth/status/758343329893318656)" during the interview, but [the tweet specifying the term was deleted from the thread](https://web.archive.org/web/20160727180951/https:/twitter.com/nicoleperlroth/status/758343816537513984). It is unclear why Steele is relunctant to use the word "rape" if those allegations were supposedly confirmed, which has been noted by several media outlets including [**ZEIT Online**](https://archive.is/Q8Vco#selection-993.0-993.142) and [**Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung**](https://web.archive.org/web/20160811160541/http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/medien/jagd-auf-jacob-appelbaum-das-tor-projekt-laviert-14378139.html).

> [Von Vergewaltigung ist im aktuellen Statement von Steele nicht die Rede](https://archive.is/Q8Vco#selection-993.0-993.72) [There is no mention of rape in the current statement from Steele].

Interestingly, [**Electronic Frontier Foundation** director](https://archive.is/qorI8) [Jillian York](https://archive.is/R5kGM) called out [**The Register**](https://web.archive.org/web/20160811131425/http://www.theregister.co.uk/Author/2886)'s [Kieren](https://web.archive.org/web/20160310222320/https:/twitter.com/kierenmccarthy) [McCarthy](https://web.archive.org/web/20160322022009/http://kierenmccarthy.com/about/) for using the phrase "[bullying sex pest](https://web.archive.org/web/20160728160633/http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/07/27/jacob_appelbaum/)" instead of "[sexual assault](https://web.archive.org/web/20160811130450/https:/twitter.com/jilliancyork/status/758592014740881408)," yet has not criticised Steele for her language choice of "[unwanted sexually aggressive behavior](https://archive.is/lkywt#selection-129.197-129.234)."

## The Website and Twitter Accounts

The website [jacobappelbaum.net](https://archive.is/8m4Yk) was created as a victim story bulletin board, with an attached [GitHub repository](https://archive.is/https://github.com/ioerrror/jacobappelbaum.net*) run by [an account created on May 26th](https://archive.is/c6sgC) that uses his name and Twitter/ GitHub handle (with the only difference being an extra 'r', this is a form of [cybersquatting](https://archive.is/HTDwb)). Contrary to some suspicions that he had been hacked, his official website is listed on his Twitter profile as [appelbaum.net](https://archive.is/bPSlT#selection-1045.1-1045.15). According to the [registration](https://archive.is/VMYhK) [information](https://archive.is/nMT7M#selection-1219.0-1219.29), the website was created using [**PrivacyProtect**](http://privacyprotect.org/about-privacyprotection/) on May 27th, two days after Appelbaum reportedly stepped down and the same day that [the resignation agreement from Steele is dated](https://web.archive.org/web/20160608122942/https://cryptome.org/2016/06/tor-appelbaum-separation.pdf). The domain is being [hosted by **GitHub** in San Francisco](https://archive.is/aA6HV) using [GitHub Pages](https://archive.is/W5UtY). The OpenPGP key given as a contact method is named "[Jacob Appelbaum's Victims Collective](https://archive.is/FPrQm)."

![site registration](https://crypto.quebec/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Capture.png)

Three Twitter accounts were created in response to Appelbaum's resignation. The first, previously going by the handle "[@TimetoDieJake](https://archive.is/ucuwA)," has been changed to "[@VictimsOfJake](https://archive.is/tHhxh)" and is promoting the victim website (you can tell it's the same account because all the tweets match prior to the former's deletion). The [profile picture](https://archive.is/e9X6Y) for both is a [psychosurrealist](https://archive.is/tdi4a#selection-281.288-281.418) piece called "[Castrate Cure](https://archive.is/dR6X7)," portraying a small female figure using a guillotine to perform a [penectomy](http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/penectomy) on a giant man. No one has publicly claimed the Twitter account, though a few **Tor Project** employees have indicated they were involved in the website. On June 7th [an FAQ was added to the site](https://archive.is/avZNp#selection-1075.1-1075.254), in which it denied any association with the Twitter accounts:

> We have seen the accounts you're talking about and they aren't associated with us. We don't know who is running them, and some of us are disturbed by their incendiary statements and graphics. We don't condone calls for violence or for Jake to self-harm.

However, based on its [first tweet](https://archive.is/8R8Ax), the account had a suspiciously [early awareness of the site](https://web.archive.org/web/20160814183918/https:/twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=jacobappelbaum.net%20until%3A2016-06-04&src=typd) and also has knowledge of [Patterson](https://archive.is/mhDRh) [blaming Appelbaum for Len Sassaman's suicide](https://archive.is/fP0A9). It is [unlikely](https://archive.is/W83f6) that they are a native German. They linked to [the site in its early stages](https://web.archive.org/web/20160603224422/https://ioerrror.github.io/jacobappelbaum.net/) (using [a link that is no longer live](https://archive.is/W5UtY)), where it very explicitly claimed to be Appelbaum.

![first version of website](https://contraspin.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/jan.png)

Under the 'Victims' header it went into what at first seemed to be random speeches, though it appears to be filler text used in at least two other places: [this blog](https://archive.is/1c355) and the 'Manifest' section of [this site](https://archive.is/7E2T4#selection-211.0-211.12), with nearly identical [theme code](https://archive.is/mVZ9E) that the victims' website appears to have copied.

Shepard is the widely suspected creator of the site. She tweeted that it was not her "[choice to keep the sources this vague, but frankly, people are afraid of retaliation](https://archive.is/V0hZw#selection-3557.1-3557.98)." (I'm assuming she means retaliation from people other than Appelbaum; for any allegations which are true, the level of detail in the stories would enable him to identify the claimant from memory and thus defeat the attempt at anonymity. This implies Appelbaum himself is not able, or has no desire, to deanonymise them publicly). She [told **WIRED**](https://archive.is/pCaSd#selection-1517.163-1517.350) that the creator was a "longtime member of the Tor community” whom she knows and trusts. She has also speculated that Appelbaum created the [@VictimsOfJake](https://archive.is/tHhxh) account to smear himself "[for sympathy](https://archive.is/VdYGT#selection-3903.7-3903.70)." Another [likely candidate](https://archive.is/Xd2qF#selection-4323.6-4323.19) is Lovecruft (see '[Isis Lovecruft](https://github.com/Enegnei/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor/blob/master/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor.md#isis-lovecruft)'), considering she [claimed to have been collecting victim stories in the previous six months](https://archive.is/4lywH#selection-185.0-185.68), which would also explain their strange dating (see '[Victims](https://github.com/Enegnei/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor/blob/master/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor.md#victims)'). [Alison Macrina](https://archive.is/Q2TTK#selection-575.0-575.24), like [Shepard](https://archive.is/dE85n#selection-3971.74-3971.98), has said the Twitter account is a "[troll](https://web.archive.org/web/20160605165004/https://twitter.com/flexlibris/status/739146421023084544)" and "should be reported. [T]hey do not represent any of the victims I've talked to." (The Twitter account [responded](https://archive.is/1QraI) by calling her a "social manipulator," yet later [appears to support her](https://archive.is/WtUjz#selection-215.1762-215.2116).) She [told **The Daily Dot**](https://archive.is/QZIdh#selection-1011.0-1019.230) that she "[vouched for the authenticity of the anonymous victims’ statements](https://archive.is/QZIdh#selection-1015.274-1015.339)" and, like Shepard and an unnamed Tor employee, knows who is behind the website. It is entirely possible that all three could be directly involved with the website's creation and updates, due to their open admissions of having knowledge of the allegations for at least a few months.

Besides the alleged victims' stories themselves, the most alarming aspect of the website was the lack of good faith displayed by the tweet button at the bottom which prompted people to share the website as if it was owned and controlled by Appelbaum:

> I just read on [@ioerror](https://twitter.com/ioerror)'s homepage https://ioerrror.github.io/jacobappelbaum.net that he has sexually assaulted many people in #tech. #wtf

The site's FAQ now claims that they are "[a small group of people of different genders](https://archive.is/avZNp#selection-865.22-865.66)" who "[never meant to impersonate Jake or to trick anyone](https://archive.is/avZNp#selection-1189.110-1189.273). With the official text, we have tried to make it clear that it isn't pretending to be made by Jake himself." However they are still linking to his [real GitHub account](https://web.archive.org/web/20160608011441/https://github.com/ioerror) at the bottom of the page and their contact email is **ioerror@riseup.net**. The new tweet prompt text is:

> I just read on https://jacobappelbaum.net that [@ioerror](https://twitter.com/ioerror) has sexually assaulted many people in #tech.

The [last part of the FAQ](https://archive.is/avZNp#selection-1249.153-1249.432) states: "We do not believe that Jake is likely to ever face criminal charges. We know that some people will say that proves that the stories here aren't true. But we know that many people understand we are telling the truth, and we believe people will be safer because we made this site."

The second Twitter account, "[@Ioerror_info](https://archive.is/cFDr1)," was made several days later. On June 9th, its first tweet was an alternative version of a story published by **Gizmodo** and **The Daily Dot** (see '[Emerson Tan, Patterson, Shepard, and Hirsch](https://github.com/Enegnei/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor/blob/master/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor.md#emerson-tan-patterson-shepard-and-hirsch)'). Like the first Twitter account, it is unknown who is behind it.

The third Twitter account, "[@JakeTheRaper](https://archive.is/Xfipv)," was made on June 14th. It mutually followed [an account](https://archive.is/ToNmk) which has been amplifying anti-Appelbaum tweets, especially those with a [mock-solidarity button](https://archive.is/qFfnZ) which [Shepard](https://archive.is/gUCRQ) and [Macrina](https://web.archive.org/web/20160801160542/https:/twitter.com/flexlibris/status/742001087952093184) also liked. It linked to a [GitHub repository](https://archive.is/9x9qC) that was created on [June 12th](https://archive.is/3PK07), run by [Caleb James DeLisle](https://archive.is/V715e) ([@cjdelisle](https://archive.is/TzJIL)), the [lead developer of **cjdns**](https://archive.is/P37aF) and [project admin](https://archive.is/lvtgI#selection-1645.0-1645.19) for [**XWiki**](https://archive.is/Bgsjv#selection-303.1-321.1), who told me that he [does not support the message of that account](https://archive.is/ZVKLz) and has [added a disclaimer](https://archive.is/qUtfY#selection-821.0-821.445) (as did I when it decided to [link here](https://archive.is/bccqo#selection-1031.1-1031.27) instead, as the account violates my anti-harassment policy).

On August 8th, [another new Twitter account](https://web.archive.org/web/20160808143950/https:/twitter.com/WatsRllyGoingOn) began tweeting very explicit [dominatrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominatrix) GIFs to portray Appelbaum as a sex slave of various women involved in the allegations, [referencing](https://web.archive.org/web/20160810190102/https://twitter.com/WatsRllyGoingOn/status/763445807357972481) the [#FemdomDarknet](https://web.archive.org/web/20160808213906/https:/twitter.com/puellavulnerata/status/547778126525521920) hashtag in the Twitter profiles of [Macrina](https://web.archive.org/web/20160810190305/https://twitter.com/WatsRllyGoingOn/status/763437977766797312) and Shepard. Shepard responded to one of them by rating it "[3/10 at best, too het](https://web.archive.org/web/20160808144309/https:/twitter.com/puellavulnerata/status/762585409608179712)" (heterosexual). When Lovecruft objected to the crass tweets, Shepard told her to "[think twice before blaming me](https://web.archive.org/web/20160808141512/https:/twitter.com/puellavulnerata/status/762650964704825344)."

### Leaked Tor-Internal Chat Logs

During the night of June 25th, [@VictimsOfJake](https://archive.is/40kys) tweeted a link to [an encrypted pastebin](https://archive.is/OIK0V) on [0bin.net](https://archive.is/Zf4Mp), which was set to expire within a day. The author claims to be someone in the security community who works on Tor, and they outline a list of nine points they consider important to "[the campaign to destroy Jake](https://archive.is/OIK0V#selection-215.121-215.149)." Among other allegations of complicated sexual relationships among various complainants and Appelbaum, it also accuses Nick Farr (see under '[Allegations](https://github.com/Enegnei/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor/blob/master/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor.md#the-allegations)') of being a "[paid hacking consultant for the CIA](https://archive.is/OIK0V#selection-215.2720-215.2777)." Farr has since asserted that [family history and alcoholism](https://archive.is/SZsqc#selection-3993.1-3993.116) disqualified him from intelligence work, but that [he's worked for the Departments of Treasury and Labor](https://archive.is/LVlJL#selection-3977.1-3977.86).

![Screenshot of 0bin.net pastebin, source: https://web.archive.org/web/20160905190650/https:/twitter.com/0xUID/status/747134618516754432](https://web.archive.org/web/20160905190650im_/https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cl5azN2WYAA_qnl.jpg)

About three hours later, a new Reddit account called [Tor-Internal](https://archive.is/JmkxL) shared that link after [posting a second pastebin](https://archive.is/Grlpq), supposedly a [leaked chat log](https://archive.is/4FMxm) of the Tor-internal "[watercooler](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-517.19-523.27)" IRC channel from November 10th, 2014. The pastebin itself was dated August 29th, 2015 (i.e. it had been public for ten months prior to going viral). The preface oddly [requests that it not be leaked](https://archive.is/6NcTI); this could indicate, if the log file is legitimate, that it was originally shared with more than one person who decided to leak it, or that the logger themselves leaked it directly and bet on the file not being widely discovered. **Cryptome**, who was [tipped](https://archive.is/FCTmY#selection-4659.1-4659.62) by the [Cypherpunks Mailing List](https://archive.is/xhBhq), became [the second person](https://archive.is/Yn2j7#selection-31375.0-31403.6) to [share the pastebin file on Twitter](https://archive.is/BvqIx) and provided [a list of the pseudonyms used in the chat matched to core **Tor Project** names](https://web.archive.org/web/20160730013718/https://twitter.com/Cryptomeorg/status/747373785209147392).

![David Chasteen](https://archive.li/hO8P6/99746b26c47950c0eac3904b925b896a49a9d846.jpg)

The subject of chat log involved confronting a recently-hired [project manager](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-5173.0-5227.43), [Iraq War](https://archive.is/RrSup) [veteran](https://archive.is/rAePv) [David Chasteen](https://archive.is/dmYpC) ("DaveC1"), who had [emailed Tor-internal](https://archive.is/A1EuX) to inform them that prior to signing on to the [six-month contract](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-5173.0-5173.104) he had not divulged that [he had just finished working for the CIA](https://archive.is/0mis7#selection-607.483-607.806) under a [TSI/SCI](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-1705.0-1777.25) (Top Secret/ Sensitive Compartmented Information, [the highest tier of three](https://web.archive.org/web/20160530023722/https://www.clearancejobs.com/security_clearance_faq.pdf)) security clearance. According to this, he only said [he worked for the State Department](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-1339.0-1363.58). He [would not divulge what surveillance programs he was involved with](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-2593.0-2599.50), but in the past he [indicated](https://archive.is/QNeXm#selection-3691.60-3691.120) he [had experience](https://archive.is/nJcrz#selection-4665.1-4665.107) [in terrorism intelligence analysis](https://archive.is/u1Pwq#selection-3893.1-3893.135). 

Chasteen frequently proposed that he was going to formally out himself [through a **Boing Boing** article](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-1537.1-1537.107) [written by](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-1537.0-1663.37) [founder](https://archive.is/kvJvq#selection-123.60-137.11) [Xeni Jardin](https://archive.is/jXOiU), which received a [negative reaction](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-829.0-865.107) as those in Tor [urged him to work directly with them](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-931.0-967.143) and [wondered how to frame the story](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-1075.0-1129.75) [to the public](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-3871.0-3901.154). There is no evidence of such a story being published by **Boing Boing** and Jardin has yet to publicly comment on whether she worked with him, though it is [clear](https://archive.is/uTlIN) [they are known](https://archive.is/mHXl7) [to each other](https://archive.is/WvhO0). Appelbaum stated that Chasteen had [threatened to sue the **Tor Project** for discrimination against veterans](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-2113.0-2113.255) when questions about his prior work first arose; Chasteen apologized and said he was "[probably more sensitive to it than most](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-2179.0-2179.215)" due to [starting](https://archive.is/0duRs) "an organization that is focused on combatting veteran stereotypes and discrimination" (alluding to [**IAVA**](https://archive.is/A9Q7I), [Iraq & Afghanistan Veterans of America](https://archive.is/Xrqh4)). However shortly after that he rudely told [Nima Fatemi](https://archive.is/yxqlC#selection-247.0-247.21) ("[mrphs](https://archive.is/PhNou)"), an Iranian exile who was [worried about the impact of this on his family](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-2305.0-2305.188), to "[check his entitlement](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-2623.0-2623.202)." It was later revealed that [Dingledine ("sekritarma") had been physically sitting with Chasteen during the chat](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-4225.0-4249.54).

![Dingledine talks about Operation Onymous, source: https://web.archive.org/web/20160823225141/https:/twitter.com/thegrugq/status/747733180342493184](https://web.archive.org/web/20160823225141im_/https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CmB7WpdXEAEpcOi.jpg)

Chasteen joined Twitter on [November 7th, 2014](https://archive.is/dmYpC#selection-1065.0-1065.20), [one day after he allegedly left the CIA](https://web.archive.org/web/20160629142311/https://cryptome.org/2016/06/david-chasteen-tor-timeline.pdf) according to [a timeline anonymously sent to **Cryptome**](https://archive.is/GaB6B) (which is yet to be verified). The timeline indicates that Chasteen had shown an interest in joining the **Tor Project** as early as January 2011; without explanation as to its relation to Chasteen (though it [appears to have been alluded to in the chat](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-1957.0-2059.142)), it also notes Operation Onymous (the [takedown of several dark web marketplaces on November 5th & 6th](https://archive.is/ANanG) by Europol, FBI, and DHS, followed by [the arrests of seventeen people](https://archive.is/7YTsu)) as a relevant event. His [only tweet for that year](https://archive.is/gSQB5) was on [December 12th](https://archive.is/VyD28) (which he [tweeted again almost a year later](https://archive.is/NfOwo#selection-3157.49-3157.92) with small changes in wording).

It is unclear whether [Reilly's](https://archive.is/N3u2k#selection-213.0-213.169) [("puffin") involvement](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-3325.0-3571.90) in [keeping the secret](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-4531.0-4591.125) and [recommending Chasteen to Tor](https://web.archive.org/web/20160629142311/https://cryptome.org/2016/06/david-chasteen-tor-timeline.pdf) influenced her resignation four months later after the Valencia meeting, as well as to what extent [WikiLeaks was informed](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-4225.0-4249.54) [about Chasteen](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-4963.0-5107.92). It is also unclear whether [disclosing Chasteen's name would have legal consequences](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-3157.0-3211.70) for the leaker, as was [asserted by Appelbaum in the chat](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-5539.0-5581.90). The [Intelligence Identities Protection Act](https://web.archive.org/web/20160401011752/http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/intel/RS21636.pdf) is a federal law amendment to the National Security Act of 1947 which specifies that "criminal penalties for the intentional, unauthorized disclosure of information identifying a covert agent" only apply if the agent was in service within five years during or prior to the disclosure. If the [timeline](https://web.archive.org/web/20160629142311/https://cryptome.org/2016/06/david-chasteen-tor-timeline.pdf) is correct and he worked with the CIA for a total of eight years (from 2006 to 2014), then the leak would fall within that sensitive 5-year time period. However, considering that Chasteen includes [information about his CIA work on his bio page for **IAVA**](https://archive.is/0mis7#selection-607.614-607.805), and no additional classified information about his work was revealed in the chat, it is quite unlikely charges would be justified.

![Intelligence Identities Protection Act](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cl6zlTXUsAAHuYR.jpg)

[Tor developer](https://archive.is/yxqlC#selection-455.0-455.14) [George Kadianakis](https://archive.is/hCExi) ("asn") shared a [link](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-5509.0-5509.60) with [former](https://archive.is/qyMV7#selection-727.0-727.92) [Tor Browser bundle signer](https://archive.is/XNLgM#selection-129.0-129.139) [Erinn Clark](https://archive.is/aAY3H) ("helix") to a [**Riseup.net** etherpad](https://pad.riseup.net/p/87Mazw3Jsdfe_pm) [first saved on November 30th, 2015](https://pad.riseup.net/p/87Mazw3Jsdfe_pm/timeslider#0) (shown via the [timeslider](https://pad.riseup.net/p/87Mazw3Jsdfe_pm/timeslider#643)), which doesn't appear to have been edited further until [June 26th 2016](https://pad.riseup.net/p/87Mazw3Jsdfe_pm/timeslider#1); someone used the pad to allege that Lovecruft was an FBI informant between [14:36](https://pad.riseup.net/p/87Mazw3Jsdfe_pm/timeslider#11)-[14:49](https://pad.riseup.net/p/87Mazw3Jsdfe_pm/timeslider#626) on June 27th. Since anyone can edit anonymously and the date of the edit is so recent (within a day of the pastebins going viral), there is no reason to believe this etherpad document is authentic.

![Riseup etherpad](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cl_LChwWYAA28AC.jpg)

There has been limited speculation about who the leaker(s) is, though the [general opinion](https://archive.is/sR8oa#selection-6009.1-6009.120) so far is that it may be [Appelbaum](https://archive.is/pJOR4) due to his [insistence on publishing through WikiLeaks](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-5437.0-5437.110) and [his accepted offer](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-5857.0-5941.32) to [log the chat](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-6421.0-6421.50) for the Tor-internal mailing thread. However it could just as easily be several other people in the channel, including Chasteen himself (notice how he repeatedly says [the story will be leaked](https://archive.is/4FMxm#selection-3913.0-3913.80)) and it would be very easy for the leaker to indirectly imply Appelbaum had done it, whether through a selective leak or by editing the log after the fact. [Joseph Cox](https://archive.is/1dHZk) of [**Motherboard**](https://archive.is/6Bgjw) [claims](https://archive.is/5IQzy) they "[confirmed the legitimacy of the transcript](https://archive.is/NHubE#selection-1495.2-1495.61)" but offered no information as to how that was done. York, who was [called](https://archive.is/Bmgc3) "[highly promiscuous](https://archive.is/OIK0V#selection-215.8241-215.8384)" in the [first pastebin](https://archive.is/qVD57), believes that leaker [could be a woman](https://archive.is/Xf9rC#selection-3963.1-3963.93) and [someone](https://archive.is/N2rB6) else [fed her the information](https://archive.is/6D6xR#selection-6757.10-6757.90).

The [@VictimsOfJake](https://archive.is/pXStd) account [shared another link](https://archive.is/SAH61) on the night of June 27th, which was a [pastebin of their response](https://archive.is/WtUjz) to the [first encrypted pastebin](https://archive.is/OIK0V), which they told **Cryptome** was "[bullshit](https://archive.is/cyx6Z#selection-3171.29-3171.46)." The response oddly begins with an [assumption about the author's age, sex, and drug inexperience](https://archive.is/WtUjz#selection-215.190-215.321) based on the "[style](https://archive.is/WtUjz#selection-215.203-215.208)" of the writing, even though basic textual analysis of vocabulary puts their own writing style at a lower grade-level quality than what they're criticising (they casually use words like "fishy," "shill," and include an emoji, which "[a young person](https://archive.is/WtUjz#selection-215.306-215.320)" is more prone to use).

## The Allegations

`Warning: Many of these stories haven't been verified or vouched for! They are here to document allegations.`

### Victims

The website profiles eight separate claims from people who were "[harassed, plagiarized, humiliated, and abused — sexually, emotionally, and physically](https://archive.is/8m4Yk#selection-245.34-245.140)." Initially, half of them were marked as placeholders ([Alice](https://archive.is/NdMrJ#selection-647.0-649.0), [Briar](https://archive.is/ZivH4#selection-647.0-649.0), Phoenix, and Sam), but the stories for "Sam" and "Phoenix" have since been added, along with more stories than the original eight (Kiwi and Nick). All, except for Nick's, are purposely under vague (i.e. anonymized) names. It has been alleged that [a supposed victim behind one of the last two remaining placeholders had their account written against their will](https://archive.is/gbw90#selection-919.0-919.381). 

The GitHub copies of the entries are PNG images, the text of which is colored blue in odd places (this is probably just due to [GitHub's syntax highlighting of the file](https://github.com/Enegnei/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor/commit/b444bae192300b2d2a79810f871d49bce0f8a11a), as it occurs around special characters). Initially, all the entries were marked with the same date of [December 31st, 2015](https://web.archive.org/web/20160605211542/https://github.com/ioerrror/jacobappelbaum.net/blob/master/content/west.md); since then, newer entries have not only been given different dates but the dates on earlier entries were changed (compare them from [both](https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://github.com/ioerrror/jacobappelbaum.net/blob/master/content/*) [archives](https://archive.is/https://github.com/ioerrror/jacobappelbaum.net*)). It is unclear what the date signifies. Synopses of the allegations submitted anonymously on the website (ordered by their dates) are as follows:

+ "[Phoenix](https://archive.is/hxfzw)," who at a post-workshop dinner was publicly propositioned for sex twice and subjected to other behavior she found humiliating ([January 26th, 2016](https://archive.is/jUxNM#selection-645.1-649.0)). [William Budington](https://archive.is/Hs1mS), a software engineer for the **Electronic Frontier Foundation**, has [personally vouched](https://archive.is/eRXca) for this story's authenticity; Micah Lee from [**The Intercept**](https://archive.is/Fydks) also [appears](https://archive.is/s32Fe) to have done so, as well as [Garrett Robinson](https://archive.is/kPNtX), [lead developer of **SecureDrop**](https://archive.is/rtrtU#selection-979.271-991.58), and [Runa Sandvik](https://archive.is/reM4m), [director of information security for **The New York Times**](https://archive.is/lReKa). 

> Based on the details provided, this incident likely occurred around the Berlin [Speakeasy](https://archive.is/X5dsZ) organized by [the **Electronic Frontier Foundation** (EFF) and the **Freedom of the Press Foundation** (FPF)](https://archive.is/gSS8z) on July 13th, 2014. Budington was indeed [in Berlin](https://archive.is/xKMXM) as an attendee, along with [Lee](https://archive.is/x6Hqt), [Sandvik](https://archive.is/q3B1D) (who [joined FPF](https://archive.is/r00mR) a [month before](https://archive.is/vI551#selection-361.335-361.344)), [Robinson](https://archive.is/1HRbv) and [Yan Zhu](https://archive.is/TOzVd) who [hosted a get-together the day prior](https://archive.is/yL13e). She [left before the incident occurred](https://archive.is/3WsXN) but has said she [heard rumours of harassment for years](https://archive.is/kAd37#selection-333.3-333.354). Considering it was a "workshop on whistleblowing platforms," it was probably the [**GlobaLeaks**](https://archive.is/NwR7M#selection-3187.5-3187.56)/ [**SecureDrop**](https://archive.is/bSGV8)/ [**Aspiration Tech** event](https://archive.is/yDOFI) occurring sometime between the [12th and 16th of July](https://archive.is/5dhs5), the topic of which may be similar to what Budington and [Zhu](https://archive.is/6TvDr) [presented](https://web.archive.org/web/20160612192330/https://freedom.press/securedrop-files/HOPEX.pdf) at [**HopeX**](https://archive.is/7QwGZ) in [New York City, July 18-20th](https://archive.is/O9zlW#selection-425.0-425.41). Appelbaum was still in [Berlin](https://archive.is/tLuiW) on the 15th and left for [Amsterdam](https://archive.is/uyBDC#selection-3961.0-3971.24) by the 16th, so it would've had to occur before then.

+ "[West](https://archive.is/TjhUQ)," who was kissed without consent by Appelbaum at a hacker event ([January 27th, 2016](https://archive.is/pEl8w#selection-647.0-649.0)).
+ "[Kiwi](https://archive.is/N10bK)," who initially "joined the digital rights community because of him," was then shamed by Appelbaum in public during the process of building their professional career ([January 28th, 2016](https://archive.is/XYS57#selection-647.0-649.0)).
+ "[Daniel](https://archive.is/R6nDq)," who was dating someone in the Tor community, says Appelbaum violated their privacy and propositioned them for sex ([January 31st, 2016](https://archive.is/hVV6V#selection-645.1-649.0)).
+ "[River](https://archive.is/0jbVl)," romantically involved with him at the time of the incident, was propositioned for group sex and, while intoxicated, sexually assaulted by Appelbaum and subjected to unwanted sexual advances by at least one of his friends at a party ([February 2nd, 2016](https://archive.is/tsKaK#selection-647.0-649.0)). Lovecruft, who later came forward herself and [claims she's spoken with "River](https://archive.is/4lywH#selection-217.227-221.47)," said there was [penetrative intercourse](https://archive.is/4lywH#selection-437.17-437.40) from both men which would justify at least two counts of rape, along with other factors: [instructing a third party to rape](https://archive.is/4lywH#selection-429.0-429.44) an [unconscious victim](https://archive.is/4lywH#selection-445.0-445.98).

Mr. Appelbaum was also under the influence of drugs that night. The female journalist who left the apartment on New Year’s morning around 10 to go to the airport assures that River made a comparatively sober impression and was at no time unconscious in the night or in the morning.

> [*Similar to the case of the Russian, River’s story also conflates diverse evenings, situations, and people in the Alice account.

Not one of the total of eight witnesses present during those three nights and two days in January remember River ever being unconscious. Also, no one says they saw her being forced to have sex against her will.

`The Vabali Spa, which Appelbaum and guests visited, in the middle of Berlin near the central station.`
 
There are also complaints about [his name frequently being first on the list of authors](https://archive.is/5Aebu#selection-835.118-835.167) for academic papers; however [the practice of listing authorship alphabetically in research](https://web.archive.org/web/20160314150541/http://www.ams.org/profession/leaders/culture/CultureStatement04.pdf) (at least in the U.S.), especially in the fields of math and computer science, is very common:

> For this reason, mathematicians traditionally list authors on joint papers in alphabetical order. An analysis of journal articles with at least one U.S. based author shows that nearly half were jointly authored. Of these, more than 75% listed the authors in alphabetical order. In pure mathematics, nearly all joint papers (over 90%) list authors alphabetically. 

> These traditions differ from other areas of scholarship, especially those that frequently involve large numbers of researchers working on a single research project. In areas of mathematics that are more closely associated to such areas, the culture and traditions may blend together. 

> While these traditions are well-known to mathematicians, they are often misunderstood by other scholars whose traditions differ. Occasionally, this works against young mathematicians — especially those with names near the end of the alphabet.

Only five people claiming to be victims of Appelbaum have publicly come forward, outside of the allegations of plagiarism by Patterson and Norton.

#### Nick Farr

The [first](https://archive.is/bFXW2) was [Nick Farr](https://archive.is/9kjWs), who is one of three to claim authorship of [a story](https://archive.is/vekwa) on the victims website. His entry is now dated [January 25th, 2016](https://archive.is/qBIJV#selection-647.0-649.0). He alleges a span of incidents of verbal harassment which occurred during the [**Chaos Communication Congress** event in 2013 (30c3)](https://web.archive.org/web/20160411055714/https://events.ccc.de/congress/2013/wiki/Main_Page), where he was an organizer of the Lightning Talks; Norton [says](https://archive.is/thLMm) she witnessed it. After approving a proposal for a talk which was going to argue that Appelbaum was a US Intelligence Operative, he was chastised first via email and then in person multiple times by both Appelbaum and "important people in the CCC." 

> [Jake demanded all the records I had received from this person. Jake also had the CCC edit the 30c3 wiki database to eliminate any trace of the offending talk.](https://archive.is/bFXW2#selection-357.161-357.319)

Furthermore, he says [a note](https://archive.is/bFXW2#selection-373.84-373.139) was left every night on his hotel room pillow (though he does not know by whom):

> "Don't make us use extreme measures. Hand it all over." 

[Computer and network](https://web.archive.org/web/20160321205746/http://www.venona.com/rdl/resume.html) [security](https://web.archive.org/web/20160526211032/http://www.venona.com/rdl/) [professional](https://archive.fo/m9nNH) [Ryan Lackey](https://web.archive.org/web/20160714144326/https:/twitter.com/octal) asked for [clarification](https://web.archive.org/web/20160918172445/https://twitter.com/octal/status/739530870575497217) regarding the messages left on Farr's pillow. He responded that "[someone unauthorized entered my room](https://archive.fo/mjQj1#selection-3913.1-3913.38)," though it "[wouldn't have been hard, necessarily,](https://archive.fo/mjQj1#selection-3913.39-3913.76) [if I remember correctly] [folks had keys to my room for orga reasons](https://archive.fo/mjQj1#selection-3913.82-3913.125)."

During the conference, Farr had not tweeted that he felt threatened or intimidated. On December 27th, he praised the work of the [Chaos Mentors](https://web.archive.org/web/20160918180514/https://events.ccc.de/congress/2013/wiki/Projects:Chaospatinnen)") for being "[an excellent example of the larger DIY effort to make the #30C3 a safe space for all](https://web.archive.org/web/20160918175731/https:/twitter.com/Nickf4rr/status/416549352703000576)." On the 29th, he tweeted "[Pro Tipp: Don't let bullies win. #30C3](https://web.archive.org/web/20160918173755/https://twitter.com/Nickf4rr/status/417421082283765760) and did not respond to requests for elaboration. Two months later, he cryptically tweeted "[Note to self: Don't volunteer for any org where gratitude is not part of the culture. #saythankyounotfsckyouwhenyourvolunteersmoveon](https://web.archive.org/web/20160918183241/https:/twitter.com/Nickf4rr/status/430590809554292736). He did not specify what organisation he was referring to, only indicating in replies that the ingratitude came from "[fellow organizers](https://web.archive.org/web/20160918183241/https:/twitter.com/Nickf4rr/status/430590809554292736)."

In March 2014, Farr published "[What I Miss Most About The 30c3](https://web.archive.org/web/20150106122225/http://www.nickfarr.org/2014/03/what-i-miss-most-about-the-30c3/)" on his now [defunct](https://archive.is/SNpXv) personal site. He wrote about his favorite aspects of the "amazing" **Chaos Communication Congress** but concluded that he wasn't planning to attend further Congresses due to family needs (with no mention of Appelbaum, which he [now claims](https://archive.is/bFXW2#selection-395.0-395.742) was the cause).

> While it’s not a huge surprise to many of you, I think I’m going to let the 30c3 be the highlight of my Congress experience and a great feeling I’m going to hold onto for a few years. I couldn’t imagine a better note to take a rest on. I’m also incredibly grateful to the team that’s taking over the Lightning Talks, I am sure they will take my work and build immensely on it. While you’re all enjoying the 31/2/3c3s, I’ll hopefully be welcoming my own family into this wonderful world you’re all helping create.


#### Alison Macrina

> "[Sam](https://archive.is/Tn1fy)," who had a "minor romantic interest" in Appelbaum and was persuaded while intoxicated to get in a bathtub with him at his apartment, followed by verbal abuse when she resisted ([February 3rd, 2016](https://archive.is/EmkCL#selection-645.1-649.0)).

The second was Alison Macrina ([@flexlibris](https://twitter.com/flexlibris)), [founder and director the **Library Freedom Project**](https://archive.is/RZunq). Four days after she [claimed to be writing about community building](https://web.archive.org/web/20160801175011/https:/twitter.com/flexlibris/status/741671363925147648) to fix Appelbaum's "[untold harm to this community](https://web.archive.org/web/20160801223355/https:/twitter.com/flexlibris/status/739990419153379328)," she published a [Medium post](https://archive.is/cwU9y) on June 15th claiming that she submitted the "Sam" story, and that she was also [friends](https://archive.is/cwU9y#selection-323.0-323.37) with "[River](https://web.archive.org/web/20160801152906/https:/twitter.com/flexlibris/status/738908260225277953)." She tweeted that she had her ["come to Jesus" moment](https://archive.is/dPnG4#selection-4463.21-4463.99) months ago and that she was "[ashamed it took me so long to figure out what was what](https://archive.is/yQRbF#selection-3645.0-3645.59)." Both she and Shepard were still on [friendly terms](https://archive.is/aGNgk) with him as late as [mid-February 2016](https://archive.is/r7jnL), around the time [Shepard claims to have first heard about the allegations](https://archive.is/pCaSd#selection-1517.351-1517.512), though Macrina's "Sam" story is dated February 3rd. Macrina may have [visited Appelbaum](https://archive.is/orMqQ) in Berlin sometime at the end of 2014 and was also [there](https://archive.is/RaYRk) as a [**Tor Project**](https://archive.is/x4z7o) [representative](https://archive.is/mSgA1) for the CIJ Symposium in [March](https://archive.is/muAFe). In between she was a fellow presenter with Appelbaum at the last "[State of the Onion](https://archive.is/6unKs)" talk for the **Chaos Communication Congress** in Hamburg, Germany; following the CCC, she was [in](https://web.archive.org/web/20160811072009/https:/twitter.com/flexlibris/status/683367657597435904) [Berlin](https://web.archive.org/web/20160811071751/https:/twitter.com/madgeofhonor/status/684011551246921728) and said she was [leaving Germany](https://web.archive.org/web/20160811071844/https:/twitter.com/flexlibris/status/683518251872174080) on [January 3rd](https://web.archive.org/web/20160811071659/https:/twitter.com/flexlibris/status/683458314378809345) with [ACLU library program director](https://web.archive.org/web/20160811075653/https://privacysos.org/contact/) [Kade Crockford](https://web.archive.org/web/20160412020704/http://conference.freepress.net/presenter/102150/kade-crockford) ([@onekade](https://twitter.com/onekade)), who had also been there for [New Years Eve](https://web.archive.org/web/20160811075101/https:/twitter.com/onekade/status/682950466020446208). Her [partner](https://archive.is/kfA1X) Franklin Bynum ([@frabyn](https://twitter.com/frabyn)), a [criminal defense attorney](https://archive.is/Aonrp) who she '[met](https://archive.is/t8VJT)' in July 2015, [migrated his law firm out of Google Apps](https://archive.is/J5zYE) after [her encouragement](https://archive.is/mhRFb#selection-239.0-239.144) to do so. They [have been](https://archive.is/g1xsR) [together](https://archive.is/dTyqM) [since at least mid-February](https://archive.is/oVCGq). He [wrote](https://archive.is/NxSJo) "[Decoding Appelbaum](https://archive.is/mQm04)" on [June 6th](https://web.archive.org/web/20160801153813/https:/twitter.com/flexlibris/status/739919012818096128), though neither [disclosed Macrina's involvement](https://archive.is/pL1vi) with the allegations at the time. On June 8th, prior to coming out as "Sam," Macrina said she [planned to organise a space at the CCC](https://web.archive.org/web/20160801223837/https:/twitter.com/flexlibris/status/740780471399907328) to "change the culture" by teaching "soft skills" through "some intentional spaces for learning about consent, abusive behaviors, transformative justice, supporting each other, and so on." In response to worries about how the **Tor Project** would handle the investigation, Macrina, who was reportedly "[deeply involved](https://archive.is/FjOk0#selection-1205.281-1205.382)," said:

> I am too. [For what it's worth], I trust Shari's leadership & action here. She took the situation seriously from day one. I'm fortunate to have an insider view, and I wouldn't be part of Tor during this if I didn't trust her. 

> -- *Alison Macrina* [@flexlibris](https:/twitter.com/flexlibris) ([June 9th, 2016](https://web.archive.org/web/20160801155736/https:/twitter.com/flexlibris/status/741057715561234433))

According to [**DIE ZEIT**](https://web.archive.org/web/20160813160106/http://www.zeit.de/kultur/2016-08/jacob-appelbaum-rape-sexual-abuse-allegations/komplettansicht), Macrina omitted crucial details from her story, including that she [went to the apartment shortly after "River" left](https://archive.is/FjOk0#selection-1277.624-1277.737) on January 3rd and [had consensual sex with Appelbaum](https://archive.is/FjOk0#selection-1179.225-1179.322).

> [Ms. Macrina reacted angrily when asked about it. It’s "shameful and prurient" to even be asked about that at all, she said. "Finally, as a general principle, it is not okay to hold up other sexual encounters to assault victims as a way of suggesting that their assault is invalid."](https://archive.is/FjOk0#selection-1185.0-1185.281)

#### Isis Lovecruft

> "[Forest](https://archive.is/bUw87)," who was propositioned for sex and sexually assaulted while she was sleeping ([February 1st, 2016](https://archive.is/1x40b#selection-647.0-649.0)).

The third was Isis Agora Lovecruft ([@isislovecruft](https://twitter.com/isislovecruft)), another [core Tor developer](https://archive.is/yxqlC#selection-395.0-395.15), who [revealed herself](https://archive.is/mmt9h) in a [blog post](https://archive.is/4lywH) as "Forest" on the same day that Macrina claimed to be "Sam." Like Macrina she wrote [less about the incident itself](https://archive.is/4lywH#selection-225.73-225.342) and more about when she allegedly [tried to resolve the situation six months ago in Valencia](https://archive.is/4lywH#selection-183.0-183.8)...

> Instead, I had planned to gather people for a secret meeting in Valencia, somewhere calm, neutral, and away from events, like on the beach, invite Jake, and have everyone willing who has ever been sexually assaulted, humiliated, harassed, or felt their boundaries disrespected, by him to take turns telling a few sentences about what he did to them and how it made them feel. Then we would tell Jake that, as his friends, we thought this needed to stop, and that we’d either deliver a list of the stories to The Tor Project and other organisations, or make all the stories public, if he refused to hold himself accountable for his actions or his behaviour did not appear to improve. In planning this secret meeting, I tried to determine what would cause Jake to perpetually disrespect other people like this, and if there were any positive things we could do to help him.

... as well as how she wants to pursue "transformative justice" based on her experience dealing with [a different man who was accused of (and later confessed to) the rape of two women](https://archive.is/4lywH#selection-179.153-179.927).

> There are some differences between how Jake is behaving to how the other anarchist I mentioned above was behaving. The other anarchist was willing to engage in the defined process, respectful of his victims’ needs, and eventually sincerely apologetic for his actions.

> I cannot condone his actions; however, I cannot condone violence and threats against Jake. Full stop. That is not productive. If he is further harmed, we never see the end of the wretched [**abused-abuser cycle**](https://web.archive.org/web/20151115231730/http://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/24/science/sad-legacy-of-abuse-the-search-for-remedies.html?).

> [**People who behave as Jake does are sick**](https://web.archive.org/web/20121105192631/http://yas.sagepub.com/content/early/2010/01/07/0044118X09358313.abstract), and they [**need help**](https://web.archive.org/web/20151115231730/http://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/24/science/sad-legacy-of-abuse-the-search-for-remedies.html?). Often, it is because [**they were severely hurt**](https://archive.is/K7vLX) at some point. As the activist adage goes, “*We need to be gentle with one another, so that we can be dangerous together*.”

Lovecruft said she had [no forgiveness](https://archive.is/OZjM5) for the women who, in her view, "[weaponized their femininity](https://archive.is/LCCRO)" to sign a letter of solidarity (see under '[Friends and Colleagues](https://github.com/Enegnei/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor/blob/master/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor.md#friends-and-colleagues)'). She later [amended](https://archive.is/e4vKk#selection-3637.0-3637.115) that the next day by saying "pity is the primary response. Signers are probably shocked/ hurt right now, and I'm very sorry for them."

[Andy Isaacson](https://web.archive.org/web/20160802183137/https://twitter.com/eqe) ([@eqe](https://twitter.com/eqe)), a [software engineer](https://web.archive.org/web/20160401233616/http://www.swissnexsanfrancisco.org/event/cryptoparty/), [kernel hacker](https://web.archive.org/web/20160308054819/https://whispersystems.org/blog/spring-break-of-code-lineup/) and [early member of **Noisebridge**](https://web.archive.org/web/20160716191407/https://noisebridge.net/wiki/User:Adi), said that Lovecruft's Valencia intervention and Appelbaum's response "[match his statements to me at the time](https://web.archive.org/web/20160615200310/https:/twitter.com/eqe/status/743158865202536448)." [Brennan Novak](https://web.archive.org/web/20160905174530/https:/twitter.com/brennannovak/status/772514920005005313), who was [Lovecruft's roommate](https://archive.fo/yknMO#selection-113.216-115.20) at the time, [said](https://web.archive.org/web/20160904195059/https://brennannovak.com/essays/shards-of-broken-glass/) he spoke both [with her (sometime in mid-January)](https://archive.fo/yknMO#selection-133.0-137.253) and later [Appelbaum (in early February)](https://archive.fo/yknMO#selection-155.0-162.0) on the subject of the intervention.

> The evening of Feb 3rd I talked with Jake for five hours. Jake was open to the idea of a group discussion, just not in Valencia, as the previous year he had been traumatized with false allegations. Jake also said he first needed to clarify if anyone was pressing legal charges presently- the intervention was only one topic we discussed- the other was that Jake had heard rumors of being called a rapist. Both of Jake[']s concerns made sense to me. It was an intense conversation, but a respectful one. I was trying to be a peaceful mediator. I believed in the idea of **transformative justice**.

According to [**DIE ZEIT**](https://web.archive.org/web/20160813160106/http://www.zeit.de/kultur/2016-08/jacob-appelbaum-rape-sexual-abuse-allegations/komplettansicht), Lovecruft had fabricated the victim story of "[Alice](https://archive.is/FjOk0#selection-1111.0-1111.306)," a young Russian activist and girlfriend of Appelbaum's, who upon [finding the account published on the victims' website](https://archive.is/FjOk0#selection-1133.0-1147.188) demanded it be taken down. Novak, who said he was also in a relationship with the woman, [confirmed](https://archive.fo/yknMO#selection-137.254-145.1) that she denied being a victim. The fabricated story was supposedly removed on [May 27th](https://web.archive.org/web/20160812153323/https:/twitter.com/grybu/status/763438126526259200) (based on a [Twitter exchange with Mondial](https://web.archive.org/web/20160812153401/https:/twitter.com/kappuchino/status/763870269136072704), who has a [cryptographically-verified copy of the deleted repository](https://web.archive.org/web/20160810222816/https://twitter.com/kappuchino/status/763382320808206336)). It brings into question how many of the other alleged victims were also not consulted.

> The organizers of the [jacobappelbaum.net](http://jacobappelbaum.net/) website committed the same mistake. An earlier version included the case of "Alice." The text was posted only for a short time. Although the time and location had been changed, her story fits precisely with the events at the congress. Mr. Appelbaum kissed Alice so violently that her lips bled.

> But when Mr. Appelbaum’s actual Russian girlfriend discovered the text on the web, she was shocked. She demanded those responsible for the website to remove it from the internet immediately. She says she doesn’t want to be used by a campaign that she rejects. "I am not a victim of Jake," she told Die Zeit. She says she told a friend about the intense kiss in confidence. This story was not merely used on the website without her permission – she says the story was also "heavily manipulated."

In November 2015, [the FBI allegedly attempted to contact Lovecruft](https://archive.is/uxlFJ) several times: [leaving a card](https://archive.is/uxlFJ#selection-129.36-129.215) at her family's home, [calling her mother's personal cell phone number](https://archive.is/uxlFJ#selection-175.566-179.319), [telling her lawyer that she should call them](https://archive.is/uxlFJ#selection-207.0-217.112) to [give her "opinion" on some documents](https://archive.is/uxlFJ#selection-321.259-325.40), which was [later retracted via voicemail](https://archive.is/uxlFJ#selection-375.219-383.361). They apparently contacted her again at the end of April 2016, [with the added threat of a subpoena](https://archive.is/uxlFJ#selection-435.0-443.26), though they claimed she was not the target of their unspecified investigation.

> The FBI has contacted my lawyer again. This time, they said, “She should meet with one of our agents in San Francisco to talk. Otherwise, are you the point of contact for serving a subpoena? She’s not the target of investigation, but, uh… we uh… need her to clear up her involvement or… uh… potential involvement in a matter.”

#### Leigh Honeywell

The fourth was [Leigh Honeywell](https://archive.is/Cm3R9), a computer and network security professional, who says [she was in an open relationship](https://archive.is/77Sx2) with Appelbaum during 2006-2007 and he "ignored my use of a [safeword](https://archive.is/xZy5n)."

> In that time we spent together, he violated boundaries I set as though they were a game, particularly at times when I was intoxicated. There were a number of times I felt afraid and violated during interactions with Jacob. Being involved with him was a steady stream of humiliations small and large as he mistreated me in front of others and over-shared about our intimate interactions with friends who were often also professional colleagues.

> For example, on several occasions in professional situations, he told other people that I was good at a particular sex act. On another occasion where my primary romantic partner at the time, [Paul Wouters](https://archive.is/yi79U), was also present, Jacob ignored my use of a safeword when his sexual behavior turned into violent behavior that violated my limits. Paul and I both had to repeatedly tell Jacob to stop, and the experience was profoundly upsetting.

On June 21st, [Honeywell](https://archive.is/uslBP), [Valerie Aurora](https://archive.is/3KfaP), and [Mary Gardiner](https://archive.is/5FjVu) published a list of recommendations for communities on [how to "prevent 'rock stars'"](https://archive.is/GAl9X). However there are [concerns](https://archive.is/Ciz5a#selection-3601.1-3650.1) that based on Aurora's [reaction to Kobeissi](https://archive.is/8pjdK#selection-7227.1-7227.92) and [others](https://archive.is/RhwaF#selection-4457.0-4506.1), she belongs to the same '[rock star](https://archive.is/qXNwS)' mentality she is supposedly condemning. On June 24th, Coleman joined Lovecruft and Macrina in praising the **Tor Project** for how "[action was taken relatively swiftly by Shari Steele](https://archive.is/5GvrC#selection-357.96-357.147)." She has not disclosed whether she knew about her [upcoming appointment](https://archive.is/L1iIh#selection-211.0-213.1014) to the [**Tor Project** board of directors](https://web.archive.org/web/20160726015109/https://www.torproject.org/about/board.html.en) at the time the blog post was written.

> [I have known Jacob for 10 + years and it was only when the woman came forward in the Tor project that I had ever heard these specific sexual assault accusations.](https://archive.is/5GvrC#selection-461.59-461.220)

#### Ásta Guðrún Helgadóttir

The fifth was [Ásta Guðrún Helgadóttir](https://archive.is/sdT41), an Icelandic politician and [Pirate Party member](https://archive.is/sGSp6), who tweeted allegations of sexual misconduct:

> [For me what did it when he jumped naked in my and my exes bed and asked for a three some. With a hard on.](https://archive.is/3x87O) [Because jumping naked in other couples bed begging for a three some is... normal? Some etiquette I wasn't aware](https://archive.is/KgdS1) [of. It didn't feel nice. It didn't feel right. Beside groping and shit. That was worse somehow.](https://archive.is/fpAqc)

### Witnesses

#### Yan Zhu

[Yan Zhu](https://archive.is/PTh3G), [senior software engineer for **Brave**](https://archive.is/W1l9v#selection-971.0-971.25), an [**Electronic Frontier Foundation** Technology Fellow](https://archive.is/Zi0C1), and [former admin at the **Tor Project**](https://archive.is/PTh3G#selection-1775.0-1775.11), published a [Medium post](https://archive.is/kAd37#selection-333.3-333.354) about her "[second-order](https://archive.is/kAd37#selection-329.45-329.57)" knowledge of the allegations on June 15th. She claimed to have "[heard multiple stories from employees who had been sexually harassed and/or manipulated by Jake over the years](https://archive.is/kAd37#selection-333.107-333.217)," but "[never anything as serious as assault](https://archive.is/kAd37#selection-333.226-333.262)." She previously "[didn't really buy](https://archive.is/kAd37#selection-333.354-333.722)" that there would have been backlash from Appelbaum had anyone spoken up, and he "[is/was a close and longtime friend of many of my ex-partners](https://archive.is/kAd37#selection-335.2-335.68)."

> [I’m left with the uncomfortable, dissonant realization that I am friends with people who have a higher tolerance for abusive community members than I think is safe for any community.](https://archive.is/kAd37#selection-339.0-339.182)

She also gives detail on [a personal story](https://archive.is/kAd37#selection-343.353-343.1108) which may establish her as a possible witness to the account of "River," though she did not mention anyone by name and has not done so since. After getting drunk at a [Berlin party](https://web.archive.org/web/20160813230050/https:/twitter.com/bcrypt/status/682908552969752576) following the **Chaos Communication Congress**, she awoke in Appelbaum's bed, "[feeling sick with no clear memory of how I got there](https://archive.is/kAd37#selection-343.512-343.564)."

> I pulled myself out of the bed, stumbled into the dark living room, and found someone I knew. I asked them whose bed I was in, and they said Jake’s. I felt gross upon hearing that, but as far as I could tell, nothing bad had happened and I had a friend at the party who was looking out for me. Still, I was disturbed by the thought of being unconscious in his room at a party with a bunch of strangers and a 3-hour hole in my memory. I vowed not to drink that much alcohol ever again, and indeed I’ve barely drank at all in the last 6 months.

> If people had spoken up earlier about Jake being a serial rapist, I wouldn’t have let down my guard and followed my friends to Jake’s apartment in an intoxicated state, regardless of whether he had been proven guilty in court or not. It’s just not a risk I could afford.

Based on an Twitter exchange with someone who "[ran into you on the street and I wished you luck at orgyleaks](https://web.archive.org/web/20160813225931/https:/twitter.com/draednaut/status/683031325872381952)," this was most likely the night of Appelbaum's New Year's Eve party. That morning, she [tweeted](https://web.archive.org/web/20160813220207/https:/twitter.com/bcrypt/status/682876748124393472):

#### Violet Blue

[Violet Blue](https://archive.is/AFFqX), a [San Francisco Bay Area freelance journalist](https://web.archive.org/web/20160920233527/https://www.tinynibbles.com/violetblue), said she's known Appelbaum since 2005 and resisted his sexual advances, as well as [physically intervened](https://archive.is/k3vJE#selection-8053.9-8053.130) when he harassed another girl at a party. She added that these experiences made her wary of "[hero worship in 'hacktivism' circles'](https://archive.is/k3vJE#selection-6669.17-6669.53)." On June 16th she [published](https://archive.is/rEJoc) a [Medium post](https://archive.is/XSMJy) with more detail on her history with Appelbaum and the incident with the girl, who she says was a friend of hers.

> Outside of Kink, in 2007, Jake had sexually targeted a female friend of mine. Her and I were going to a large tech party in December; I think it was a Wikimedia party, and Jimmy Wales was there. My friend was feeling hunted by Jake, and early in the party she said he was trying to isolate her, and told me she was scared. She is not a big or strong girl, nor is she loud, and he was trying to convince her to go into a stairwell with him. The convincing turned into trying to pull her away physically, grabbing at her hands. I locked my arm with hers, and put myself in between her and Jake. All while he was trying to reach around me, while he was telling me to let go. I said No, she’s not going with you. I insisted a bit louder, *No*. He was livid.

Blue also claimed Appelbaum publicly humiliated her in front of his friends by saying she "[gives great head](https://archive.is/XSMJy#selection-451.225-451.275)." She claimed he had confused her "[with a certain blond blogger](https://archive.is/XSMJy#selection-451.506-451.567)," which may have been a reference to Jardin. In June 2008, [Blue](https://web.archive.org/web/20160305061747/http://www.tinynibbles.com/blogarchives/2008/06/digital-notes-and-errata.html) [noticed](https://web.archive.org/web/20160920235145/https://www.tinynibbles.com/blogarchives/2008/06/when-transparency-does-not-equal-erased.html) that about [seventy two](https://web.archive.org/web/20090227163739/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/webscout/2008/07/regarding-boing.html) **Boing Boing** posts [mentioning or linking to her work](https://web.archive.org/web/20080701164050/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/webscout/2008/06/violet-blue-scr.html) had been "[unpublished](https://web.archive.org/web/20080702132701/http://www.boingboing.net/2008/07/01/that-violet-blue-thi.html)" from the blog's archives "[for personal reasons](https://web.archive.org/web/20080728211729/http://www.boingboing.net/2008/07/18/lessons-learned.html)," which [Jardin chose not to elaborate on](https://archive.is/GILb#selection-669.0-673.311). Blue has publicly called her a "[douche](https://web.archive.org/web/20160920224103/https:/twitter.com/violetblue/status/488478917359980544)," agreed with a statement claiming Jardin had "[an active and deceitful role](https://web.archive.org/web/20160920224239/https:/twitter.com/violetblue/status/386609394462384128)" in building Appelbaum's fame, but [denied](https://archive.fo/3wQob) she had been sexually involved with both Appelbaum and Jardin.

(Note: Appelbaum *has* previously [stated that he worked for **kink.com**](https://archive.is/ZguXt); in fact, the statement was made in relation to [his objection](https://archive.is/OeqHP) to [Blue's sex talk](https://archive.is/OwOek) [being pulled](https://archive.is/4a4WA) from the [**BSides San Francisco** conference](https://archive.is/0UHK2) in February 2013 [due to complaints from Aurora](https://archive.is/CvBUb) of the [**Ada Initiative**](https://archive.is/8oUnH), despite [Blue's](https://archive.is/SeUp9) clear history of [sex-positivism](https://archive.is/wdSmV#selection-735.59-735.77). However she [misidentifies Shepard as "Tor Project's director"](https://archive.is/XSMJy#selection-363.2-367.2) even though the **WIRED** interview she links to [clearly says Shepard is a core developer](https://archive.is/FsG0A#selection-1541.163-1541.659), not a director. Furthermore there appears to be some confusion in her summarization of the timeline of events surrounding [the Valencia intervention](https://archive.is/XSMJy#selection-555.0-563.59); the incident with Reilly at the Tor dinner was at the beginning of [March 2015](https://archive.is/DrGwH), whereas Lovecruft said she began planning the intervention [six months ago](https://archive.is/4lywH#selection-185.0-185.68). Blue appears to be falsely conflating the two events.)

[Randi Lee Harper](https://archive.is/byGrf#selection-47425.0-47494.1), a [San Francisco Bay Area activist for online abuse prevention](https://archive.is/agPio), criticised the men who only now were coming forward to vouch for accounts of Appelbaum's behavior they had witnessed:

> [All these men are coming forward with stories of how they saw stuff. Good for you. Where the fuck were you? Why didn't you do something?](https://archive.is/HYub2#selection-3919.0-3919.136) [You will not get a "good lil ally" badge for coming forward to confirm stories now. You waited for women to take the risk. Cowards.](https://archive.is/HYub2#selection-4327.0-4327.131) -- *Randi Lee Harper* [@randileeharper](https://twitter.com/randileeharper) (June 16th, 2016)

#### Emerson Tan, Patterson, Shepard, and Hirsch

[Emerson Tan](https://archive.is/TEIUh), another computer and network security professional, came forward through an interview with both [**Gizmodo**](https://archive.is/K2tdt) and [**The Daily Dot**](https://archive.is/QZIdh). He said Patterson and Shepard were also "eyewitnesses" to the incident, which occurred in the middle of the night (no date specified other than "[it was the day we arrived at CCC"](https://archive.is/QZIdh#selection-1047.91-1047.123)) during the [2015 **Chaos Communication Congress** (32c3)](https://web.archive.org/web/20160607230238/https://events.ccc.de/congress/2015/wiki/Static:Main_Page) in Hamburg, Germany.

> "At about 2 or 3 a.m. in the morning I happen to be talking to [Patterson], [Shepard] and Jacob Appelbaum and a group of other people who have come out of the congress hall into the lobby of the Raddison Blu hotel in Hamburg,” Tan told Gizmodo. “Jake has his hands all over this girl, and she is very obviously not very happy. You know, she’s looking for her bag, they’re having a conversation and she’s looking for her bag she can’t find her bag and she appears to be really quite distressed and Appelbaum forcibly attempts to try and kiss her, grabs her arm and her backside and makes a move for her breasts.

> ... And the other males who we were with were basically just kind of joking amongst themselves and don’t really seem to see anything wrong with it, which is really quite distressing,” Tan said. “So I watched this for about two to three minutes and then I decide to go and do something and just mount a very very subtle intervention. Which is, I go over, I shake Jake’s hand I tell him what a great job he’s doing with the Tor project and the rest of it and that gives the girl roughly the 30 seconds she needs to find her bag without being in an undistracted fashion. She left, and I found her hiding out in the hotel bar later, after Jake had left. She was pretty composed but obviously upset."

In **The Daily Dot** interview he gave a more detailed account, including what the girl, who Patterson claimed was "[obviously a little bit inebriated](https://archive.is/QZIdh#selection-1059.80-1059.113)," did [after the incident](https://archive.is/QZIdh#selection-1087.0-1087.256).

> Tan said afterwards he spoke briefly with the woman. He asked if she wanted to file a police report, but she was unwilling. She left the hotel before any of the witnesses learned who she was. The incident was never reported to police or to the Tor Project.

[Dan Hirsch](https://web.archive.org/web/20160731220858/https://twitter.com/thequux) ([@thequux](https://twitter.com/thequux)), who [married Patterson](https://www.flickr.com/photos/pinguino/sets/72157667188334564) on [June 11th](https://web.archive.org/web/20160731222612/https://twitter.com/pukingmonkey/status/741824783675883521), was also a [witness](https://web.archive.org/web/20160731182508/http://www.dailydot.com/layer8/jacob-appelbaum-tor-project-suspension-sexual-misconduct-victims/) but was not named in the **Gizmodo** interview.

> “Most of Jake’s attention was focused on some girl who was somewhat shorter than he was,” Hirsch said. “She was cornered against the bar, looking around I presumed to try to find an escape route or for someone she could get the attention of.”

Tan posted the story on his Facebook page, saying that even though he didn't know who the girl was he had submitted it to Steele as part of the investigation. He also mentioned seeing Appelbaum "[trying to take upskirt photos of women" and "making lewd comments and allegations of threesomes with various members of the privacy community](https://archive.is/K2tdt#selection-1379.28-1379.233)." Shepard added that once when Appelbaum was "good drunk" in a Berlin bar in July of 2013, he "[discussed how he would ‘use my ass’](https://archive.is/K2tdt#selection-1385.127-1385.162)."

![Tan's Facebook posts https://web.archive.org/web/20160731161412/https:/twitter.com/oxbloodruffin/status/740275426581450753](https://web.archive.org/web/20160731161412im_/https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CkX8kzqXEAA5azs.jpg)

However, Tan's story has since been contested. On June 9th, the first alternative story released by [@Ioerror_info](https://archive.is/cFDr1) using [**TwitLonger**](https://archive.is/UX9Jk) claimed that Tan's interpretation of the incident, which occurred on the night of December 26th, was wrong. The "girl," a woman named [Jill Bähring](https://archive.is/nZJGj), had not been subjected to unwanted sexual advances by Appelbaum, and in fact has been "[romantically involved](https://archive.is/UX9Jk#selection-445.1-445.96)" with him. (Her Twitter account was [initially private](https://archive.is/syKKA) but she made it public within a few hours of the statement being published to [authenticate that it was from her](https://archive.is/nZJGj#selection-3499.0-3499.110).) She admitted to having temporarily lost her bag and being "[emotionally distressed](https://archive.is/UX9Jk#selection-457.41-457.63)" at the time, but it was not because of Appelbaum.

> I did indeed look not very happy. I was emotionally distressed at that time and told Jake, one of my close confidants, about my situation. He did have his hands all over me, just as I had my hands all over him. At no point did Jake forcibly attempt to try and kiss me, nor did he grab me in any inappropriate manner.

> While we were talking, I realized that I didn’t have my bag with me, and started looking for it. Anyone who has ever lost sight of their wallet and phone will look “quite distressed” as a consequence. According to Tan and Patterson, none of our friends seemed to see anything wrong with that situation: “And the other males who we were with were basically just kind of joking amongst themselves and don’t really seem to see anything wrong with it, which is really quite distressing” 

> This is true. There was nothing wrong with it. I was among several friends with whom I felt absolutely safe.

She also said that Tan's account of how he approached them wasn't accurate.

> The next day, I wasn’t going to be at the conference, so I didn’t expect to see Jake for a couple of weeks. Jake and I said goodbye to each other in the hotel lobby, and we kissed. But since my friend was waiting for me to leave, I playfully pushed Jake away. At that time, I noticed Emerson Tan for the first time – since he was intervening at that point. He states: “So I watched this for about two to three minutes and then I decide to go and do something and just mount a very very subtle intervention. Which is, I go over, I shake Jake’s hand I tell him what a great job he’s doing with the Tor project and the rest of it and that gives the girl roughly the 30 seconds she needs to find her bag without being in an undistracted fashion.”

> I recall Tan approaching me, asking me if Jacob was harassing me. I said he wasn't. Nevertheless, Tan dragged me away and immediately started talking intensely to Jake. At that point I decided to leave, since my friend was waiting for me. I walked him to his hotel, which was only a couple of blocks away.

She ended the statement by questioning why "[a highly distorted version of my experience](https://archive.is/UX9Jk#selection-509.1-521.68)" had been published in the first place. [Pepijn Le Heux](https://archive.is/h6nay), a Dutch attorney and [Tor advocate](https://archive.is/Q2TTK#selection-507.0-507.24) based in Amsterdam, [retweeted the statement](https://archive.is/9VklJ#selection-1921.0-1921.95) saying "I was at Raddison Blu that night, I know these people & as far as I know this story is accurate." Zhu tweeted that she "[was also around that night and didn't do anything because Jill seemed ok. Glad to hear that she was](https://archive.is/1ZMM7)."

**Gizmodo** subsequently [published a new story](https://archive.is/dPAfG) with Jill Bähring's account, though they have yet to add an update to [the original](https://archive.is/toIZA) despite at least [one request](https://archive.is/mxiMI) to do so; **The Daily Dot** both [added an update to their original story](https://archive.is/VBMmD#selection-1201.195-1213.57) and published [a new one](https://archive.is/Qdima) (though they have yet to correct the statement about [Bähring's story being published by Appelbaum](https://archive.is/vHxH2#selection-1255.0-1257.41)). Dell Cameron, one of three authors collaborating on coverage at **The Daily Dot**, tweeted [screenshots of emails](https://archive.is/HATig#selection-5799.1-5799.18) to show he was trying to contact Bähring through Tomassini, as she has so far not spoken directly to the press. Tan was also contacted to [comment](https://archive.is/Qdima#selection-987.0-987.146) on the fact that his story had been refuted and [denied approaching her to ask if she was being harassed](https://archive.is/wozbD#selection-7027.0-7027.42):

> “This is a situation open to misinterpretation because I do not know what she's thinking,” Tan said. “I'm fully willing to stand up and say that.”

Neither Patterson nor Shepard revoked their statements, though they both initially made brief comments on the fact that Bähring refuted their story. In reply to someone pointing out that she had yet to make any retraction, [Patterson](https://web.archive.org/web/20160731202718/https:/twitter.com/maradydd/status/744633281073778688) said that "[there are some goddamn impatient people on the internet. Response forthcoming, but I have a life and a job](https://archive.is/oioum#selection-6789.1-6789.108)." Shepard characterized the story as "[a minor incident the press inflated](https://archive.is/sStV1#selection-5705.79-5705.114)" and [said she was not a reliable judge](https://web.archive.org/web/20160731200225/https:/twitter.com/puellavulnerata/status/744618405030989826) of the situation.

On August 9th, Patterson [published](https://web.archive.org/web/20160809124836/https:/twitter.com/maradydd/status/762951432794431492) the [first](https://web.archive.org/web/20160809113724/https://status451.com/2016/08/09/too-late-for-the-pebbles-to-vote-part-1/) of [three blog posts](https://web.archive.org/web/20160809163741/https://twitter.com/maradydd/status/762968756675018752) she wrote regarding the Appelbaum allegations, including [a response to her witness account of the CCC incident being refuted](https://archive.is/JfVTD#selection-485.0-505.266) by Bähring.

> Bähring avers that her interactions with Appelbaum were entirely consensual, which I am relieved and pleased to hear. I’m not sure why anyone would expect any other reaction out of me, seeing as how I’ve sung the praises of making mistakes and owning them in public for so long that I’ve [given invited talks on it](http://pyvideo.org/video/1563/fail-faster-fail-better). The interaction I observed took place within my line of sight but out of my earshot, and if I misinterpreted it, then I genuinely am sorry about that. Ultimately, Bähring makes her own decisions about what she consents to or doesn’t. If I was mistaken, well, good.

Patterson outlined several of Appelbaum's "[decade-plus... sexual and professional misconduct](https://archive.is/JfVTD#selection-379.58-379.107)" allegations, many of which she identified as belonging to [narcissistic personality disorder and psychopathy](https://archive.is/JfVTD#selection-277.191-309.540) (including [the need to be adored](https://archive.is/JfVTD#selection-593.260-613.25) and [isolating victims](https://archive.is/JfVTD#selection-827.356-837.1)). As references she cited [David Chapman](https://web.archive.org/web/20160809143132/https://twitter.com/Meaningness)'s [essay on the 'invasion' of subcultures](https://web.archive.org/web/20160726152454/http://meaningness.com/metablog/geeks-mops-sociopaths) and chapters from an online book "[The Psychopath Code - Cracking The Predators That Stalk Us](https://web.archive.org/web/20160809133325/https://www.gitbook.com/book/hintjens/psychopathcode/details)" [written](https://web.archive.org/web/20160809133520/https://www.gitbook.com/@hintjens) by [programmer and distributed computing expert](https://archive.is/5EAGc) [Pieter Hintjens](https://web.archive.org/web/20160809135029/https://twitter.com/hintjens). "[Appelbaum's siloing techniques](https://archive.is/JfVTD#selection-793.70-793.100)," including the "[infosec *reductio ad absurdum*](https://archive.is/JfVTD#selection-817.182-827.46)" of "[fedjacketing](https://archive.is/JfVTD#selection-803.105-803.237)" and recruiting authority figures as a "[force multiplier](https://archive.is/JfVTD#selection-901.223-901.353)," she claims, led to an "[abandonment of the community’s core values](https://archive.is/JfVTD#selection-885.5-885.47)." 

She again repeated [the allegation of plagiarism](https://archive.is/JfVTD#selection-359.140-359.300) and their "[fauxpology](https://archive.is/JfVTD#selection-961.204-961.214)" [reconciliation](https://archive.is/JfVTD#selection-961.0-971.1) (see '[Len Sassaman and Plagiarism Allegations](https://github.com/Enegnei/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor/blob/master/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor.md#len-sassaman-and-plagiarism-allegations)') without specifying what was stolen or even mentioning Appelbaum's co-speakers.

She referred to Tomassini as a ["low-rent publicist"](https://archive.is/JfVTD#selection-583.4-583.27) for not getting Appelbaum to "[bang out an apology of the 'I’m sorry you feel that way' variety](https://archive.is/JfVTD#selection-593.84-593.148)" to Honeywell, Reilly, Macrina, and Lovecruft. However she also criticised Honeywell's advocation for "[private affinity groups for marginalized groups](https://archive.is/i7ckd#selection-721.313-721.360)" regarding "[members of marginalized groups whom the existing affinity group considers unpersons](https://archive.is/JfVTD#selection-671.258-671.341)," since she, Shepard and others were apparently excluded from the '[underground whisper network](https://archive.is/TqmIu#selection-1443.323-1443.425).' She links a [reply-comment from Honeywell to Shepard](https://web.archive.org/web/20160509142918/https://geekfeminism.org/2014/11/23/the-desolation-of-linkspam-23-november-2014/) (commenter 'A') regarding their citation of [**PandoDaily**](https://web.archive.org/web/20160413140848/https://pando.com/about/), a [San Francisco-based](https://web.archive.org/web/20160809151507/https:/twitter.com/PandoDaily) [blogging platform](https://web.archive.org/web/20160702140512/https://pando.com/2012/01/16/why-i-started-pandodaily/) whose members were involved in the online harassment of the **Tor Project** (see '[Online Harassment of the Tor Project](https://github.com/Enegnei/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor/blob/master/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor.md#online-harassment-of-the-tor-project)'). She also [alleged](https://archive.is/JfVTD#selection-859.274-879.99) that during the [biannual Tor developer meeting](https://web.archive.org/web/20160612195118/https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2016WinterDevMeeting) in Valencia from [February 27th to March 6th](https://web.archive.org/web/20160809154027/https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/valencia2016), an organizer attempted to collect handwriting samples from attendees after someone wrote "[Thanks for a sexual-assault-free Tor meeting!](https://archive.is/JfVTD#selection-869.80-869.202)" on a poster for Appelbaum (who unbeknownst to most of the attendees [had been quietly banned](https://archive.is/7U5Kj#selection-155.1-155.167)).

Patterson's [next](https://web.archive.org/web/20160810132553/https:/twitter.com/maradydd/status/763308511807823872) [blog post](https://web.archive.org/web/20160810132653/https://status451.com/2016/08/10/too-late-for-the-pebbles-to-vote-part-2/) mostly focused on sociological theories regarding the psychology of '[internet mobs](https://archive.is/wIWrL#selection-219.0-247.307)', trying to justify [why she became involved](https://archive.is/wIWrL#selection-319.0-363.266), and [what should be done with abusers](https://archive.is/wIWrL#selection-367.0-467.616). She particularly draws from [Bynum's interpretation of Appelbaum's statement](https://archive.is/wIWrL#selection-399.527-423.1), even though the [highlighted quote](https://archive.is/mQm04#selection-383.0-383.35) in question was not said by Appelbaum.

Her [third and final](https://web.archive.org/web/20160811111555/https:/twitter.com/maradydd/status/763691089136091136) [blog post](https://web.archive.org/web/20160811112214/https://status451.com/2016/08/11/too-late-for-the-pebbles-to-vote-part-3/) again focuses on the [psychology of 'information silos'](https://archive.is/vlG0a#selection-215.0-234.0) and [how sociopaths violate](https://archive.is/vlG0a#selection-235.0-297.343) [boundaries](https://archive.is/vlG0a#selection-601.0-653.289), including those of [organisations and communities](https://archive.is/vlG0a#selection-301.0-489.51). Besides calling Appelbaum a "[petty would-be tyrant](https://archive.is/vlG0a#selection-207.475-207.732)," she makes only [one comment](https://archive.is/vlG0a#selection-395.0-395.221) specifically about him in the essay, regarding the necessity of [flattening the organisational hierarchy](https://archive.is/vlG0a#selection-391.0-391.56):

> Tor’s organizational hierarchy was already flat, but this didn’t help them until Shari Steele came on board. Jake had co-opted leadership so thoroughly that they retaliated against Karen Reilly for reporting his behavior.

#### Christopher Sheats

Christopher Sheats ([@yawnbox](https://web.archive.org/web/20160908143826/https:/twitter.com/yawnbox)), [board chair](https://archive.fo/jyEEc#selection-381.25-393.18) of the [**Seattle Privacy Coalition**](https://web.archive.org/web/20160823181055/https:/twitter.com/SeattlePrivacy) and [technology & library program intern for the **American Civil Liberties Union of Washington**](https://web.archive.org/web/20160915165639/https://aclu-wa.org/blog/organizations-supporting-tor-help-us-help-you), [published](https://web.archive.org/web/20160908123714/https:/twitter.com/yawnbox/status/773716593989648384) a blog post on September 7th containing [his witness account](https://archive.is/zXpAI) regarding the allegations by "River." He described [his brief interaction with her at the Vabali Spa](https://archive.is/zXpAI#selection-77.56-77.877) and the [evening movie session at Appelbaum's apartment](https://archive.is/zXpAI#selection-81.0-169.299), where he saw "[Jacob and River were cuddling throughout the entire movie](https://archive.is/zXpAI#selection-109.0-109.58)."

> [If River was under the influence of drugs or alcohol, it was not apparent. At no point did she seem distressed or abused. Nobody did. Further, no one was having sex in the living room.](https://archive.is/zXpAI#selection-133.0-133.184)

## The Public Reaction

### Cult of the Dead Cow

As a [result](https://archive.is/q2zil) of the allegations, Appelbaum has been [removed](https://web.archive.org/web/20160606171748/http://w3.cultdeadcow.com/cms/team_bio.html) from the computer underground group [Cult of the Dead Cow (cDc)](https://web.archive.org/web/20160603052306/http://w3.cultdeadcow.com/cms/about.html), of which he has been [a member since July 2008](https://web.archive.org/web/20160312134611/http://w3.cultdeadcow.com/cms/team_bio.html). Their [official statement](https://archive.is/M1Kgd#selection-67.202-67.401) says that "as we have become aware of the anonymous accusations of sexual assault, as well as the stories told by individuals we know and trust, we've decided to remove Jake from the herd effective immediately." 

[Oxblood Ruffian](https://archive.is/GxVPv) (pseudonym), who has been a cDc member since April 1996, released their own individual statement on Appelbaum being removed from the group and how he "[used our name to advance his career and gain entrance to circles that might have been closed to him](https://archive.is/0fJev)" without actually contributing anything. He also says "[preying upon the vulnerable is an ungendered pathology](https://archive.is/0fJev#selection-381.355-381.410)" and defends the right of the victims to remain anonymous.

### Freedom of the Press Foundation

On June 8th, **Freedom of the Press Foundation**'s co-founder and executive director [Trevor Timm](https://archive.is/LRcD9) [announced](https://archive.is/JDoO8) that Appelbaum was also [removed](https://archive.is/Eyzzi) from his [position](https://archive.is/lUiZL#selection-401.0-401.15) on their volunteer technical advisory board.

> In light of the allegations that have been made, Jacob Appelbaum is no longer a member of our outside volunteer technical advisory board. We hope that the serious accusations made against him, and his denial of them, are resolved as fairly and as expeditiously as possible.

Fellow [board volunteer](https://web.archive.org/web/20160915022708/https://freedom.press/about/tech-advisory) [Eleanor Saitta](https://web.archive.org/web/20160915023320/https://dymaxion.org/me.html) ([@Dymaxion](https://web.archive.org/web/20160915024558/https:/twitter.com/Dymaxion)) had [vaguely accused Appelbaum](https://web.archive.org/web/20160914222547/https:/twitter.com/Dymaxion/status/529957200748621824) of [public](https://web.archive.org/web/20160914223252/https:/twitter.com/Dymaxion/status/530026459835142144) "[aggressive harassment](https://web.archive.org/web/20160914223252/https:/twitter.com/Dymaxion/status/530026459835142144)" during a dispute about the **Electronic Frontier Foundation**'s [Secure Messaging Scorecard](https://web.archive.org/web/20160915025718/https://www.eff.org/node/82654) [project](https://web.archive.org/web/20160915025915/https://www.eff.org/secure-messaging-scorecard) in November 2014. [Former](https://archive.is/YT5Mc#selection-381.0-381.15) [systems administrator](https://web.archive.org/web/20160328165000/https://freedom.press/about/staff/kevin-gallagher) [Kevin Gallagher](https://archive.is/87FaO) (who [announced](https://archive.is/XnqrV) he was [leaving **Freedom of the Press Foundation**](https://archive.is/ST3kN) on June 24th) said the tech advisory board "[is not the most active thing. Jake had not even communicated with them in several years](https://archive.is/xFMNc)."

### Purism

**Purism** quietly [removed](https://archive.is/6DS15) him after [a potential customer objected](https://archive.is/FV78W) to Appelbaum still being listed as their [security advisor](https://web.archive.org/web/20160604221755/https://puri.sm/about/).

### Chaos Computer Club

On June 9th, the **Chaos Computer Club** (CCC) released a "[reminder](https://archive.is/tcgqB)" which did not directly mention Appelbaum or the allegations, but stated that anyone who violates the [ethical principles](https://archive.is/tcgqB#selection-185.0-195.92) of their "galatic organization" is "not welcome."

> In light of recent accusations against a regular visitor and speaker at our events, the Chaos Computer Club re-emphasizes the following: The CCC is, by its charter and by common consent, a galactic organization of all life forms. We are dedicated to providing a safe, comfortable, and supportive experience for everybody attending our events.

> ... [As stated previously](https://archive.is/7OwVs), we do not tolerate life forms who refuse to share this openness and respect towards others: Creatures that are not excellent to others are not welcome.

Upon the reminder's release it was not clear whether Appelbaum was henceforth not welcome or if they intended to investigate, or already had investigated, the reports of harassment at their events. On June 17th, they [clearly stated that Appelbaum is no longer welcome](https://archive.is/peoaA).

### Noisebridge

On June 10th, the educational San Francisco hackerspace [**Noisebridge**](https://archive.is/ZQZjb) released a PGP-signed [statement](https://archive.is/1Uv7E#selection-51.472-51.573) that Appelbaum was "no longer welcome in our community, either in its physical or online spaces." On June 21st, they [officially banned him](https://archive.is/bQDcq#selection-107.0-107.1266) through community consensus after it was proposed by [San Francisco Bay Area developer](https://hackerbots.net/~tdfischer/cv.pdf) [Torrie](https://archive.is/I6n8n) [Fischer](https://archive.is/5jlY9) ([@tdfischer_](https://archive.is/SSmIg#selection-9425.0-9453.3)). [Rubin Starset](https://archive.is/LOAdI), a founding member of **Noisebridge**, also [published](https://archive.is/gydhN) [a longer statement](https://archive.is/0JXDc) on how the community's inclusive culture had to be remedied to prevent such harassment and abuse in the future.

![Noisebridge ban](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Clh5V_7UgAAWbeW.jpg)

 Appelbaum [co-founded](https://archive.is/O7gQd#selection-2189.162-2193.1) [**Noisebridge**](https://archive.is/EPz1X) with security expert [Mitch Altman](https://archive.is/lIJMY) (Sassaman was also "[mildly involved](https://archive.is/7Z94w#selection-3163.27-3163.42)" despite being [out of the country](https://archive.is/OCNJk)) within the summer and [fall](https://archive.is/3dNbK) of 2007 as an extension of the **Chaos Computer Club**. He is still listed as a [user](https://archive.is/QVDgl) on their '[People](https://archive.is/7MsIa#selection-1213.0-1213.13)' page (though note it is not a membership list) and he is also the [domain owner](https://archive.is/6fMei#selection-773.17-773.32) of their website [noisebridge.net](https://archive.is/7JD6Y).

### Friends and Colleagues

[M.C. McGrath](https://archive.is/ke9Yv), founder of the [non-profit **Transparency Toolkit**](https://archive.is/PkZzu), shared a [picture](https://archive.is/apZ0h) of the side of a building which had been graffitied to say "*A rapist lives here | ein Vergewaltiger wohnt hier*!" with an arrow pointing to the middle window. This targeting is reminiscent of [1970s Manhattan feminists](https://books.google.com/books?id=kpNarH7t9CkC&pg=PA289&lpg=PA289&dq=%22a+rapist+lives+here%22&source=bl&ots=WoxzxaSDm5&sig=kINLSemfTubvNb5_7SkgoRpgfas&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiw55u0uMXNAhVFWRQKHVfFBeEQ6AEIKTAC#v=onepage&q=%22A%20Rapist%20Lives%20Here%22&f=true):

> **Lutz, Mary E.** (1949 - ) became a member of The Feminists (1972) in NYC, a group that wrote and published tracts against marriage, for man-hating, and for re-establishing matriarchy. Members also conducted actions and gave speeches advocating political education and direct action. "Once I gave a talk at Dartmouth College in which I shocked students by proclaiming women should consider aborting male fetuses, a remark for which I paid dearly," she says. In 1973, TF targeted Manhattan rapists by identifying their workplaces and homes, and stenciling "A Rapist Lives Here" in red paint on buildings and sidewalks. -- *Feminists Who Changed America, 1963-1975* by Barbara J. Love (2006)

McGrath [said](https://archive.is/YgtDs) this was Appelbaum's house in [Prenzlauer Berg](https://archive.is/VNuvO#selection-975.110-975.125), Berlin, (where [he's lived since 2013](https://archive.is/skoYv#selection-1223.668-1223.844)), but the defacer(s) had [targeted the wrong apartment window](https://archive.is/giZem). He later posted [a second picture](https://archive.is/FDe1v) made in daylight. He reacted by saying "[this is not justice for anyone](https://archive.is/dOA5L#selection-2315.0-2315.34)" and "the mob going after [@ioerror](https://twitter.com/ioerror) has done more to make me feel unsafe than people in the intelligence community threatening me about my work." The identity of the defacer(s) is unknown, but Shepard speculated that Appelbaum "[graffitied his own apartment for sympathy](https://archive.is/VdYGT#selection-3903.101-4020.1)."

![defaced building](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ckm-FkAWgAAJzEc.jpg)

Though he also did not directly mention Appelbaum by name or the allegations, [Daniel J. Bernstein](https://web.archive.org/web/20160607185552/https://twitter.com/hashbreaker), professor of mathematics and computer science at the [**Eindhoven University of Technology**](https://archive.is/7muWD#selection-18219.1-18219.26) where [Appelbaum is currently studying](https://web.archive.org/web/20160914213055/https://www.win.tue.nl/eipsi/staff.html) as a [PhD student](https://web.archive.org/web/20160915180751/https:/twitter.com/ioerror/status/638735997396774912), published [a blog post](https://archive.is/NPmvQ) warning of the consequences of skirting due process.

>  Is it really so hard to recognize both of these directions of error? If I prejudge and punish alleged culprits who have not had their day in court, then I will inevitably punish some innocent people: the unfortunate reality is that **many accusations of crimes are false**. If I prejudge and punish accusers who have not had their day in court, then I will inevitably punish some innocent people: the unfortunate reality is that **many accusations of crimes are true**.

> When I say "day in court", what I really mean is **due process**. Due process is a set of ethical principles that civilization has painstakingly developed over several centuries, recognizing that punishment is corrupted by many sources of error on both sides: communication is poor; memories are faulty; sometimes people don't tell the whole truth; sometimes people tell something other than the truth.

> ...  It's really not that hard to stay calm and say something like this: "We weren't there. At this point we can't be sure what happened. Sometimes accusations are true, and sometimes they aren't. It's important for a neutral judge to hear testimony from the accuser and from the accused."

> But not everyone stays calm. Angry people continue to join these mobs. They blog and tweet and report their ill-informed speculations in favor of the accuser or the accused, confident in their own righteousness and blithely unaware of the possibility of being wrong. Ultimately the accused and the accuser are both punished, truth be damned. 

On June 11th, a group of women consisting of "friends, colleagues, co-workers or partners" of Appelbaum [released](https://archive.is/ochsL) a [statement](https://web.archive.org/web/20160611153425/https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2858953/Statement-Appelbaum-11-06.pdf) criticising the "coordinated and one-sided attack on his character and work."

> We are not apologists for any genuine wrongdoing, and as women working in this community we know that 
there are struggles around sexism. However, simple punitivism is not how the human rights that we all defend 
should be enforced or framed.

> We believe that an open and evidence-based discussion in this situation is necessary to allow our community to 
develop better processes to handle any allegations. Furiously targeting one person without allowing for proper 
fact analysis will never solve the bigger structural problem that has been highlighted. We should use this moment
to grow and make things better, not destroy the movement and create divisions. We need to create a channel for 
discussions on how to make things better. 

The initial twelve signatories of this statement are: [Renata Avila](https://archive.is/PNR07), [Human Rights Lawyer](https://web.archive.org/web/20160319080136/http://webfoundation.org/about/executive-team/renata-avila/); Susan Benn, Artist; [Cathleen Berger](https://archive.is/oEdah), Policy Advisor; [Geraldine de Bastion](https://archive.is/DftjZ), Policy Expert; Annegret Falter, Political Scientist; [Marie Gutbub](https://archive.is/EJlcF), Journalist; [Sarah Harrison](https://web.archive.org/web/20160316133415/https://wikileaks.org/Profile-Sarah-Harrison.html), Journalist; Christy Lange, [Writer](https://archive.is/EgmRA#selection-1777.0-1789.63); [Isik Mater](https://archive.is/QWygD), Infosec Specialist; [Angela Richter](https://archive.is/99Fk6), [Theatre Director](https://web.archive.org/web/20160611160912/http://cultureforum.eu/person/angela-richter/); [Felicity Ruby](https://felicityruby.com/), PhD Candidate; [Joana Veron](https://archive.is/gSgid), Lawyer.

They also [created](https://archive.is/IidiH#selection-3361.0-3391.91) a [website](https://archive.is/KVN4s) with a copy of the statement, inviting others who agree with "[the spirit of this letter](https://archive.is/KVN4s#selection-115.126-115.151)," but may not be colleagues or personal friends of Appelbaum, to sign it by contacting this email: **dueprocess@riseup.net**. To date, there are forty-eight additional signatures and only two people later requested to have their names removed: [Herzmut](https://archive.is/1pBih#selection-171.0-171.25) and [Bailey Lamon](https://archive.is/P2RGo#selection-175.0-175.69).

> We therefore invite all others to add their names to this list (using the below contact details) to show their agreement with the spirit of this letter - solidarity with Jake in how this is being handled, on the side of justice for all, and in belief of the need to develop a safe space for accessing the issues to enable building open and transparent guidelines to deal with sexism and gender issues within our infosec and digital rights communities.

A [tweet prompt](https://archive.is/ymmJL) was added to the website:

> In Solidarity with Jacob Appelbaum [@ioerror](https://twitter.com/ioerror) and on the Side of Justice for All. We urge others to add their names to https://ourresponse.org/

Though Nerad was [not one of the signatories](https://archive.is/8CJYx#selection-5281.1-5281.73), she expressed [a similar sentiment](https://archive.is/ae5EQ) [very early on](https://archive.is/crtyC) when the allegations were first being made, that she does not believe [shaming](https://archive.is/mghYZ#selection-4975.70-4975.77) him [so soon](https://archive.is/JeBHl#selection-5305.94-5305.123) is a "[sustainable holding pattern](https://archive.is/lwl2E#selection-4661.60-4661.87)."

On August 19th, [Shannon Cunningham](https://web.archive.org/web/20160823192331/http://utexas.academia.edu/ShannonCunningham) [shared](https://archive.is/hBnhg) her [account of experiences](https://archive.is/XlBb6) with Appelbaum, [Macrina](https://archive.is/XlBb6#selection-325.0-329.705), [Lovecruft](https://archive.is/XlBb6#selection-303.228-303.928), and [Budington](https://archive.is/XlBb6#selection-427.0-431.338). In late 2014, Appelbaum offered to cover her [airfare](https://archive.is/sZEPw) and other living expenses so that she could attend that year's **Chaos Communication Congress**; he was simultaneously paying for half of Macrina's airfare and it was settled that the two would room together since [they were previously acquainted](https://archive.is/XlBb6#selection-293.0-293.453) and [expressed a mutual](https://web.archive.org/web/20160825154543/https:/twitter.com/flexlibris/status/506146028081676288) [interest in meeting](https://web.archive.org/web/20160825154818/https:/twitter.com/flexlibris/status/550106186654425088). During a misunderstanding about [Cunningham's sleeping arrangements](https://archive.is/XlBb6#selection-307.0-311.188) in Berlin following the conference, Macrina allegedly [tried to convince her that Appelbaum had "abandoned" her](https://archive.is/XlBb6#selection-325.0-325.476) because [they weren't sleeping together](https://archive.is/XlBb6#selection-325.478-325.812) and proceeded to [share sensitive information about him](https://archive.is/XlBb6#selection-329.0-329.162), at which point Cunningham [stopped communicating with her](https://archive.is/XlBb6#selection-329.163-329.705). Their last [public communication](https://web.archive.org/web/20160825163018/https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=%40dhammicmarxist%20%40flexlibris%20until%3A2016-08-14&src=typd) prior to Cunningham avoiding and blocking Macrina (until after the Appelbaum allegations were publicised) was January 6th, 2015. At some point, the [misunderstanding with Appelbaum was resolved](https://archive.is/XlBb6#selection-337.0-345.201).

> [Given the volume of false characterizations of Jake floating around amidst the smears, I hope he will not mind me saying… These characterizations of him as a “rockstar,” as “aggressive,” as “selfish” — I don’t see how one could know Jake much at all while choosing these as their go-to descriptions of him, barring bad faith. Perhaps that we come from similar backgrounds has offered me some insight, but whenever I read these stories going around describing his personality, I’ve been unable to recognize him in them. While the those traits, when they do come out, might seem abrasive, when taken in context, the picture is very different. What I do recognize in them, however, is the characterization of him I long ago disputed with Alison, as I again had to push back against this recently, when she DM’d me again to tell me she could not believe I was defending Jake after he had “abandoned” me.](https://archive.is/XlBb6#selection-359.0-359.899)

> [There have certainly been occasions during which he and I have butted heads, but one thing that struck me about our interaction versus that of others with him, is that if I felt he was over-assertive in some regard, I would push back. Perhaps this is because I was not trying to win his favor, but rather that I appreciate him and his personality, and respect his ideas, experiences, and values. Part of being a friend is arguing and contradicting someone when you believe they are wrong, and likewise part of being a friend is letting someone know they’re being difficult even while going out of your way to maximize their comfort.](https://archive.is/XlBb6#selection-363.0-363.632)

### Internet Freedom Festival

On June 15th, **The Daily Dot** published [information](https://archive.is/NRQB4#selection-4629.0-4629.23) from [Tom Lowenthal](https://web.archive.org/web/20150326060100/http://tomlowenthal.com/), currently staff technologist for the [**Committee to Protect Journalists** (CPJ)](https://archive.is/Pr5hq#selection-6449.0-6449.18) and a track lead for journalism & media at the [**Internet Freedom Festival**](https://archive.is/6nauY#selection-3111.0-3111.31), which in 2016 was held [March 1-6th](https://archive.is/C1tid). Lowenthal says that the organizers of the **Internet Freedom Festival** were aware of the allegations prior to the event and "[decided in advance that Appelbaum would not be allowed at the conference or inside the venue and had a contingency plan in place in case he tried to participate](https://archive.is/emaP9#selection-1057.0-1057.389)." 

> [There's a major public vulnerability which is being exploited in the wild. You need to patch it.](https://archive.is/7TNb7#selection-3143.0-3143.96) [Appelbaum wasn't the problem, just a really bad symptom. Our communities are still vulnerable to the attack he used.](https://archive.is/7TNb7#selection-3661.0-3661.116) 

> -- *Tom Lowenthal* [@flamsmark](https://twitter.com/flamsmark) (June 22nd, 2016)

It isn't clear how long [Lowenthal](https://archive.is/r3Bqn) has [personally had knowledge of the allegations](https://archive.is/coBSA#selection-291.47-307.212) about Appelbaum's behavior, or how the **Internet Freedom Festival** became aware of them more than three months prior to the announcement of Appelbaum's resigation from the **Tor Project**. Considering that the festival was [advertised as the post-meeting destination](https://web.archive.org/web/20160612195118/https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2016WinterDevMeeting) for those attending the biannual Tor developer meeting in February, word of [the incident](https://archive.is/JfVTD#selection-859.0-879.99) there may have either spread and/or the same people were involved.

### Debian Project

On June 18th, Appelbaum was [removed](https://archive.is/XHMBl) as a [developer at the **Debian Project**](https://archive.is/zQ281#selection-14885.0-14901.15), a role which he had [acquired in 2013 after ten years of involvement](https://web.archive.org/web/20160723102603/https:/twitter.com/ioerror/status/362690659188084736). 

### Linux Australia

[Russell](https://archive.is/YGtex) [Coker](https://archive.is/BzFIy), a Melbourne-based [Debian developer](https://archive.is/zQ281#selection-14961.0-14977.13), [wrote to the Linux Australia mailing list](https://archive.is/97YS4) requesting that Appelbaum be barred from attending the Australian National Linux Conference (LCA) and that the group release a public statement. On June 22nd [Hugh Blemings](https://archive.is/WPBVw), [president of Linux Australia](https://archive.is/qBOUy), released a [statement](https://archive.is/eAX8g) from himself and the council on the mailing list saying that they were aware of the recent allegations made but they [had not received any reports of misconduct during the 2012 conference](https://archive.is/eAX8g#selection-65.238-65.399) when [Appelbaum was a keynote speaker](https://archive.is/IU6jO). 

> As facts in this matter become clear Linux Australia will consider what, if any, action is appropriate in relation to Mr Appelbaum’s potential involvement in future Linux Australia activities.

On July 1st, Blemings released a [second statement officially banning Appelbaum](https://archive.is/YiEM5#selection-59.749-59.962) from Linux Australia events.

### The Tor Project

On July 16th, Tor directory authority operator '[Lucky Green](https://archive.is/sYloW)' announced that they would be shutting down their Dutch-based [bridge](https://archive.is/LhRoL) authority "[Tonga](https://archive.is/XwPVP)" as well as "[a number of fast Tor relays](https://archive.is/CYkMj#selection-427.40-427.67)." [Berlin-based writer](https://web.archive.org/web/20160227031505/https://events.ccc.de/congress/2015/Fahrplan/events/7134.html) [Bethany Horne](https://web.archive.org/web/20150825185040/https:/twitter.com/bbhorne) said this announcement has been "[demoralizing](https://web.archive.org/web/20160723081938/https:/twitter.com/bbhorne/status/756711893981663233)" with regards to the Tor community.

![Tonga DA shutting down](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CnlvOBSWYAEk8dN.jpg)

As a [bridge authority](https://archive.fo/WR9X1#selection-4023.0-4023.501), '[Tonga](https://archive.is/uU7Ft)' had to be replaced immediately and it was feared that the process of removing it would "cause severe disruption for the bridge ecosystem," according to a [leaked](https://archive.is/yftsO) [email allegedly sent by Hahn](https://archive.is/nnEtT).

![Hahn email on dir/bridge auth](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CnpqIj6W8AQofhc.jpg)

Lovecruft [announced via the mailing list](https://web.archive.org/web/20160804153134/https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-project/2016-August/000612.html) that she was handling the replacement process (including [bridges](https://web.archive.org/web/20160807160944/https:/twitter.com/isislovecruft/status/761372548705710080) that [had stopped working](https://web.archive.org/web/20160807164315/https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-project/2016-August/000644.html)) and that [the new bridge authority server](https://web.archive.org/web/20160807162049/https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-project/2016-August/000636.html) would be in [**Greenhost**](https://web.archive.org/web/20160528154208/https://greenhost.net/about-us/)'s [Amsterdam](https://web.archive.org/web/20160604160110/https://greenhost.net/about-us/contact/) offices. '[Tonga](https://archive.is/IZr2O)' was [officially](https://web.archive.org/web/20160826171636/https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-0287-released-important-fixes) [decomissioned](https://web.archive.org/web/20160826141758/https:/twitter.com/isislovecruft/status/769076039788232704) and [replaced](https://web.archive.org/web/20160830145041/https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-project/2016-August/000683.html) with [Lovecruft's new bridge authority](https://web.archive.org/web/20160826141822/https:/twitter.com/isislovecruft/status/769080569900793856) '[Bifröst](https://archive.fo/YIFCv)' on [August 26th](https://web.archive.org/web/20160831153828/https:/twitter.com/torproject/status/770930782948950016). In a [blog post](https://web.archive.org/web/20160901145513/https://twitter.com/isislovecruft/status/771354179831001088) summarising the transition, Lovecruft claims they are looking to "[decentralise the Bridge Authority/BridgeDB systems without simply turning a single point-of-failure into multiple points-of-failure](https://web.archive.org/web/20160901144131/https://blog.torproject.org/blog/new-bridge-authority)."

On [July 23rd](https://web.archive.org/web/20160723203844/https:/twitter.com/DerVeloc1ty), [programmer](https://web.archive.org/web/20150923110022/http://blog.veloc1ty.de/about-me/) [Josef 'veloc1ty' Stautner](https://archive.is/cpQnP) announced that he had [deactivated his Tor exit relay](https://web.archive.org/web/20160723203559/https://blog.veloc1ty.de/2016/07/23/tor-shutdown-meines-exit-relays/), which he has been [running since at least December 2014](https://web.archive.org/web/20150113013445/http://blog.veloc1ty.de/2014/12/22/mein-tor-exit-relay/) after [learning about Tor through Snowden's NSA leaks](https://archive.is/6xTNj#selection-361.0-361.298). He said his withdrawal of support was due to how the community handled the allegations against Appelbaum:

> Vor zwei bis drei Wochen habe ich mein Tor Exit Relay heruntergefahren [*Two or three weeks ago, I shut down my Tor exit relay*]. Der Grund hierfür ist der Umgang der Tor „Community“ über die Vorwürfe gegen ioerror [*The reason for this is the handling by the Tor "community" of the allegations against ioerror*]. Viele Threads gingen auf den Mailing Lists auf und alle spekulierten wild rum [*Many threads went up on the mailing lists and all speculated around wildly*]. Niemand lieferte Beweise und viele Opfer versteckten sich in der Anonymität [*No one provided evidence and many victims hid in anonymity*].

> Das Verhalten der sogenannten Community hat mich zutiefst bestürzt [*The behavior of the so-called community has shocked me deeply*]. Danach habe ich beschlossen mein Relay abzuschalten und das Projekt nicht weiter zu unterstützen [*After that I decided to shut down my relay and no longer support the project*]. 

> Der Daemon ist deinstalliert und die Keys wurde sicher gelöscht [*The daemon is uninstalled and the keys have been safely deleted*]. Ich habe mich von allen Mailinglisten abgemeldet [*I have unsubscribed myself from all mailing lists*]. Die negativen Seiten von Tor überwiegen damit für mich [*Thus for me, the negative aspects of Tor outweigh*].

On July 28th, [Macrina](https://web.archive.org/web/20160729200915/https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-project/2016-July/000551.html) [announced](https://web.archive.org/web/20160729201721/https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-project/2016-July/000552.html) the creation of the [Tor Project Social Contract 1.0](https://storm.torproject.org/shared/UleWiALOvWDnWxEqPcAfr49tkHaM-h7PlSmoHlRb5Rv), meant to be "[a set of promises to our community about what Tor stands for and why we create it](https://archive.is/7gWyU#selection-71.235-71.352)," which was [in the works since at least late February](https://web.archive.org/web/20160612213942/https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2016WinterDevMeeting/Notes/TorSocialContract). The [deadline for ratification requests](https://archive.is/7gWyU#selection-71.481-71.641) was August 6th. The next day she also said they had a code of conduct "[in the works](https://web.archive.org/web/20160730022951/https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-project/2016-July/000563.html)" by the [Community Team](https://web.archive.org/web/20160730023513/https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/teams/CommunityTeam) (of which she is the leader) but provided other documents regarding **Tor Project** company policy, including: [conflicts of interest](https://web.archive.org/web/20160730023345/https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-project/attachments/20160729/c0fd5492/attachment-0004.pdf), [internal complaint review process](https://web.archive.org/web/20160730023928/https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-project/attachments/20160729/c0fd5492/attachment-0005.pdf), [harassment and discrimination prevention](https://web.archive.org/web/20160730024043/https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-project/attachments/20160729/c0fd5492/attachment-0006.pdf), and [employee communications](https://web.archive.org/web/20160730024209/https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-project/attachments/20160729/c0fd5492/attachment-0007.pdf). These documents appear to be relatively new as [Fatemi was not aware of them and they were not previously publicly available](https://web.archive.org/web/20160730024927/https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-project/2016-July/000566.html). People wrote in to say that the "[free of cost](https://web.archive.org/web/20160804142012/https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-project/2016-August/000592.html)" stipulation and the [conflation of harassment and discrimination under the same policy may cause problems](https://web.archive.org/web/20160730182956/https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-project/2016-July/000571.html). The most controversial criticism came from [Tor2Web developer](https://web.archive.org/web/20160904154020/https://tor2web.org/) [Virgil Griffith](https://web.archive.org/web/20160808192628/https://twitter.com/virgilgr), who argued that the **Tor Project**'s [public "human-rights branding" may put affiliated activists in authoritarian countries at risk](https://web.archive.org/web/20160808192814/https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-project/2016-July/000557.html). A few days later, [he left the **Tor Project**](https://web.archive.org/web/20160808191617/https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-project/2016-July/000579.html) over the issue and took down [his blog page on his work with Tor](https://web.archive.org/web/20160503124544/http://virgil.gr/tor/). On September 4th, he [published](https://web.archive.org/web/20160904172734/https:/twitter.com/virgilgr/status/772431761498312704) a [Medium post](https://archive.fo/jCj46), which he [subsequently](https://archive.is/KpGTr) [updated](https://archive.is/FHCWX), to restate his objections and formally announce his resignation as a [volunteer data scientist](https://archive.fo/cWueA#selection-2987.0-2993.15). [Patterson](https://web.archive.org/web/20160905152714/https:/twitter.com/maradydd/status/772718905840328704) responded that "[Tor already ejected](https://archive.fo/Fswko#selection-339.86-339.105)" him, [repeating](https://archive.fo/piQr4#selection-339.110-343.1) [Lovecruft's allegation](https://web.archive.org/web/20160905154330/https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-project/2016-May/000355.html) from a May discussion thread started by [Tom Ritter](https://web.archive.org/web/20160905154922/https:/twitter.com/TomRittervg) on [ethical guidelines for networked systems research](https://web.archive.org/web/20160609070134/http://networkedsystemsethics.net/index.php?title=Networked_Systems_Ethics) and whether [Tor2Web](https://web.archive.org/web/20160905160123/https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-project/2016-May/000332.html)'s explicit allowance for [crawling of onion services](https://web.archive.org/web/20160905171156/https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-project/2016-May/000356.html) was [against Tor policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20160905160634/https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-project/2016-May/000354.html). Lovecruft claimed Griffith had [harvested Tor hidden-service directory](https://archive.is/lmXL8#selection-115.159-115.179) ([HSDir](https://archive.is/0cjL3#selection-777.0-783.159)) data and [tried to sell it to **INTERPOL** and the Singaporean government](https://archive.is/lmXL8#selection-115.184-115.294), which qualified as "[questionable research activity](https://web.archive.org/web/20160905155320/https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2015SummerDevMeeting/ResearchEthicsNotes)." Griffith [replied](https://web.archive.org/web/20160905152642/https:/twitter.com/virgilgr/status/772724095507132416) to Patterson as well as [Macrina](https://web.archive.org/web/20160905170814/https:/twitter.com/virgilgr/status/772843163660627968) saying "[the chain of attributed behavior is untrue](https://archive.is/xCoOl#selection-311.85-311.127)." He is [cited as an author of a Tor tech report](https://web.archive.org/web/20160513044054/https://research.torproject.org/techreports.html), though he hasn't been listed under core members or past contributors on the **Tor Project** website.

On July 31st, a [ticket item](https://web.archive.org/web/20160826181341/https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/19794) was reported to the **Tor Project** requesting the historical and current versions of several [corporate documents](https://web.archive.org/web/20160826182555/https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/TorProjectCorporateDocuments) (including bylaws, voting members, and meeting minutes). Though a few of the documents are either already online or in the process of being drawn up, several have still not been made available.

On August 8th, Macrina [announced](https://web.archive.org/web/20160808193027/https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-project/2016-August/000651.html) that [the final draft of the Social Contract](https://pad.riseup.net/p/G38YNGrXoOtr) was ready. She [published](https://web.archive.org/web/20160810162547/https:/twitter.com/flexlibris/status/763395548233818113) it to [the **Tor Project**](https://web.archive.org/web/20160810185313/https://twitter.com/torproject/status/763446841182711808)'s [blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20160810163144/https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-social-contract) on August 10th. In a review from **TechCrunch**, [editor](https://archive.is/nEGTO) and journalist [Natasha Lomas](https://web.archive.org/web/20160801120218/http://techcrunch.com/author/natasha-lomas/) said the contract had "[warm-sounding words about transparency and honesty](https://archive.is/Ki9GM#selection-2227.38-2227.88)" but it "[might be accused of lacking specific substance — if you were reading it with a critical eye and keeping count of qualifiers and caveats.](https://archive.is/Ki9GM#selection-2227.90-2227.226)" [**BoingBoing** co-editor](https://web.archive.org/web/20160903193502/https://boingboing.net/about), [science fiction writer](https://web.archive.org/web/20160903192034/http://craphound.com/bio/), and [**Electronic Frontier Foundation** special advisor](https://web.archive.org/web/20160903192657/https://www.eff.org/about/staff/cory-doctorow) [Cory Doctrow](https://web.archive.org/web/20160903192909/https://twitter.com/doctorow) [described](https://web.archive.org/web/20160812183850/http://boingboing.net/2016/08/12/the-tor-projects-social-cont.html) it as "[generally excellent](https://archive.fo/jTTyB#selection-473.17-473.36)," though he "[balked at a bit of weasel-wording in the section on openness](https://archive.fo/jTTyB#selection-473.68-473.128)."

On August 16th, journalist and [Tor advocate](https://archive.is/rotkk#selection-381.0-381.22) [Marie Gutbub](https://web.archive.org/web/20160816223153/https:/twitter.com/shiromarieke) [announced](https://web.archive.org/web/20160816222856/https:/twitter.com/shiromarieke/status/765634647485214720) through a public email to Tor-internal that she was [leaving the **Tor Project**](https://archive.is/7U5Kj) after being consistently shunned by both [management](https://archive.is/7U5Kj#selection-211.1-211.133) and [other Tor members](https://archive.is/7U5Kj#selection-117.371-117.561) since the allegations against Appelbaum were publicised in June. Her resignation as an advocate followed the day after Lovecruft publicly called her a "[rape apologist](https://web.archive.org/web/20160815214230/https:/twitter.com/isislovecruft/status/765292571958452225)." Gutbub was also [deliberately excluded](https://archive.is/7U5Kj#selection-205.1-211.133) from the [Seattle developer meeting](https://web.archive.org/web/20160902151730/https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2016SummerMeeting) and [Open Hack Day](https://web.archive.org/web/20160902174129/https://twitter.com/flexlibris/status/771761290675052544) scheduled for [late](https://web.archive.org/web/20160902011011/https:/twitter.com/torproject/status/771465958116433920) [September](https://web.archive.org/web/20160915233850/https:/twitter.com/torproject/status/776547760166187008), among at least two other people who hadn't declared their support for [jacobappelbaum.net](http://jacobappelbaum.net/). Pointing to [chat logs](https://archive.is/7U5Kj#selection-173.0-187.165) of recent [conversations](https://archive.is/7U5Kj#selection-277.0-285.134) she'd had or [witnessed](https://archive.is/7U5Kj#selection-253.0-273.459) with various people in the **Tor Project**, she said that the organisation had been demonstrating "[a worrying lack of transparency](https://archive.is/7U5Kj#selection-141.0-159.305)."

> It is really hard to talk about Tor's action because there is a lack of transparency. Why does everything have to be hidden, even from tor-internal? Isn't that contrary to the way Tor has worked in the past? While I understand that the people who claim they are victims need to be protected and I accept the fact that their names cannot be disclosed, I do not understand why all the info must be kept secret from people who dedicate a major part of their daily lives to the Tor project.

> Why did Tor first take action (by making Jake quit) and only then started an investigation? Shouldn't that be the other way around? Did Tor do any fact-checking before acting based on the allegations? Why was Jake banned from TorDev in March, and why was his absence not addressed officially at any moment? Why did no discussion about this topic happen at that point?

> I cannot even point all the details (from the blogposts to all the refusals to talk on tor-internal) where Tor showed a worrying lack of transparency. I am extremely worried about the direction taken by the organization. This is, to be clear, not a version of the Tor Project I want to be associated with.

Gutbub later responded to messages she had received following her departure:

> [In the last days, I have recieved a lot of support messages. Thank you everyone <3](https://web.archive.org/web/20160821010509/https:/twitter.com/shiromarieke/status/767077303230705664) [But reading all these kind messages from people calling me "courageous", "brave", etc., made me really sad.](https://web.archive.org/web/20160821010608/https:/twitter.com/shiromarieke/status/767077346356498432) [I'm ready to take risks, but I wish I wouldn't have to be brave by taking actions against an organization I used to respect.](https://web.archive.org/web/20160821010706/https:/twitter.com/shiromarieke/status/767077376089960448) [I wish I would have taken risks speaking with/for Tor, not against them.

`Shepard, Gutbub, and Matthewson at Tor's Berlin developer meeting / Open Hack Day in September 2015`

Following Gutbub's resignation, [**Seattle Privacy Coalition**](https://web.archive.org/web/20160823181055/https:/twitter.com/SeattlePrivacy) [co-founder](https://archive.is/jyEEc#selection-353.0-353.14) and Tor exit relay operator [David Robinson](https://twitter.com/jdormansteele) [announced](https://web.archive.org/web/20160823173138/https:/twitter.com/jdormansteele/status/765678898264743937) he no longer planned to [collaborate with, or financially support](https://archive.is/Y27gz), the **Tor Project**. After his home was [raided](https://web.archive.org/web/20160405155311/http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/04/04/472992023/when-a-dark-web-volunteer-gets-raided-by-the-police) and [thoroughly searched](https://web.archive.org/web/20160401150912/http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/seattle-police-raid-home-privacy-activists-who-maintain-tor-anonymity-network-node-1552524) by [Seattle police](https://web.archive.org/web/20160823175811/https:/twitter.com/jdormansteele/status/715936818563256320) in the early morning of [March 30th](https://web.archive.org/web/20160401101109/http://www.forbes.com/sites/matthickey/2016/03/31/couple-endures-early-morning-seattle-police-raid-for-hosting-tor-server-4chan-involved/#ffc26876efc3), he had previously "[planned to discuss Tor’s response to the raid](https://archive.is/Y27gz#selection-199.38-201.12)" with Steele, but recinded the offer due to Tor's ongoing management issues regarding the Appelbaum allegations.

> [In short, I have no confidence in Tor’s will or ability to ensure professionalism among its personnel or to execute an effective communications policy. As a Tor volunteer and contributor, I feel at risk not only from the Seattle Police Department, but now also from Tor Project members who are targeting a growing list of individuals for shunning and character assassination with no apparent push-back from management — indeed, with management’s collusion.](https://archive.is/Y27gz#selection-291.0-303.50)

According to [**BuzzFeed**](https://web.archive.org/web/20160823215718/https:/twitter.com/BuzzFeedNews/status/768124630141894660)'s [senior technology reporter](https://web.archive.org/web/20160823220316/https://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein) [Joseph Bernstein](https://web.archive.org/web/20160823215938/https:/twitter.com/Bernstein/status/768122605828177926), [Steele characterised their departures](https://web.archive.org/web/20160823215605/https://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein/dissent-and-distrust-in-tor-community-following-ja?utm_term=.uykrjYDBz#.niwK9NaYB) as "[sad and unfortunate](https://archive.is/MDNhc#selection-3107.0-3107.205)," but called Gutbub's account of being deliberately excluded from the Seattle developer meeting a "[conspiracy](https://archive.is/MDNhc#selection-3131.0-3131.116)" because "[she hasn’t been working on Tor recently. She hasn’t been contributing.](https://archive.is/MDNhc#selection-3131.117-3131.218)" However, based on an [excerpt of an email sent by Steele to Tor-internal](https://archive.is/MDNhc#selection-3137.0-3137.666) that **BuzzFeed** claims to have obtained, Gutbub was disinvited due to the Appelbaum controversy:

![Email from Shari Steele, source: https://web.archive.org/web/20160824171042/https:/twitter.com/shiromarieke/status/768464017040011264](https://web.archive.org/web/20160824171042im_/https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cqoh41mWcAEoV8Y.jpg:large)

On August 18th, a Tor relay operator going by the handle "stderr" (short for "[standard error stream](https://web.archive.org/web/20160810112536/http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/stderr/)") submitted a [proposal](https://archive.is/Fv6QU) to the [**Tor Project** mailing list](https://web.archive.org/web/20160818223802/https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-project/2016-August/000669.html) for a vote of "no confidence" in Steele. A plan for a [general Tor strike](https://archive.is/6NJUr) was later [published](https://web.archive.org/web/20160821150427/https://www.reddit.com/user/TorStrike) by [another anonymous account](https://archive.is/iB3h8) that said [they were not associated](https://archive.is/p4VDI) with 'stderr,' supposedly due to disagreeing with their claim about the identity of Tor's investigator.

![Tor strike date & demands, source: https://web.archive.org/web/20160821020658/https:/twitter.com/Cryptomeorg/status/767125055650357253](https://web.archive.org/web/20160821020658im_/https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CqVfq-NWcAAXaF2.jpg:small)

The 'stderr' operator claimed that Macrina's boyfriend Bynum was chosen by the **Tor Project** "[as the 'outside counsel' to investigate the allegations sexual assault and sexual harassment against Jacob Appelbaum](https://archive.is/itrtn#selection-71.73-71.191)." [Bynum](https://web.archive.org/web/20160818223921/https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-project/2016-August/000670.html), [Dingledine](https://web.archive.org/web/20160818224035/https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-project/2016-August/000671.html), and [the **Tor Project** account](https://web.archive.org/web/20160818223453/https:/twitter.com/torproject/status/766398565392547841) responded to say this was false. (A Redditor going by the handle "[Investiga-Tor](https://web.archive.org/web/20160821022826/https://www.reddit.com/user/Investiga-Tor)" claimed the outside counsel was actually [Rebecca A. Speer](https://web.archive.org/web/20160821022915/http://www.workplacelaw.com/about-us) of **Speer Associates**, which specialises in employment law. The **Tor Project** has not confirmed this, though Sheats [named her in his witness account](https://archive.is/zXpAI#selection-173.120-173.398)). [Macrina](https://web.archive.org/web/20160818223306/https:/twitter.com/flexlibris/status/766368952763187200) also denied [coordinating the investigation](https://web.archive.org/web/20160819172130/https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-project/2016-August/000673.html) and countered the strike call by asking people to run relays "[as an act of solidarity with victims of domestic and sexual violence](https://web.archive.org/web/20160819165235/https:/twitter.com/flexlibris/status/766660949038211073)," which became an [opposition campaign](https://web.archive.org/web/20160823230850/https:/twitter.com/search?q=%23torstrike&src=typd) to "[hijack](https://web.archive.org/web/20160823133507/https:/twitter.com/Teelin/status/768012952226058240)" the [strike's hashtag](https://web.archive.org/web/20160902173753/https:/twitter.com/TorStrikeSept1). Bynum [created a new Tor bridge](https://web.archive.org/web/20160820191150/https:/twitter.com/frabyn/status/767052457855844352) nicknamed '[bifrost](https://archive.is/XOyRc)'.

Nerad responded to the demands of the Tor strike: "[you can't build trust with a corpse](https://web.archive.org/web/20160823131755/https://plus.google.com/+ShavaNerad/posts/BPh49Yey147)."

> Basically, this is a call to dissolve the project, it's a culture jamming monkey wrenching set of demands that is not a discussion, but simply adding heat to an already overheated conflict spiral.  I'd encourage the author to contact me for a debate if he or she cares to actually learn something about the history of the project and how it got here.

> I am not happy about what is going on at Tor either.  I am not happy about the current administration.  I am not happy about the grievance process, and I am not happy about how we got to that point.  I am not happy that a CIA staffer got on staff without being vetted, either.

> But this is not the way you deal with "building trust" -- you can't build trust with a corpse. It's just not useful.

According to the **Tor Project**, the counter-strike [resulted in fifty two new relays](https://web.archive.org/web/20160907120820/https:/twitter.com/torproject/status/773262838467100672) joining the network.

On the same day as the first strike announcement, [Virginia-based](https://archive.is/yIHv7) [security researcher](https://archive.fo/SBbJP) [Joshua Yabut](https://web.archive.org/web/20160826170730/https:/twitter.com/jmprcx) ([@jmprcx](https://web.archive.org/web/20160916180156/https://twitter.com/jmprcx) and [@movrcx](https://web.archive.org/web/20160916175926/https://twitter.com/movrcx)) declared that he had started "[a non-SJW fork](https://web.archive.org/web/20160819171112/https:/twitter.com/jmprcx/status/766324296625053696)" of the Tor browser, aka "[IndieOnion](https://web.archive.org/web/20160916175623/https://twitter.com/indieonion)." On [August 19th](https://archive.fo/RoCdB#selection-4571.183-4571.221) he launched the [Rotor Browser website](https://web.archive.org/web/20160901180616/https://rotorbrowser.com/) and proceeded to [remove or black out](https://archive.is/u2QLa) [Tor iconography](https://archive.fo/V3kIF) from the forked browser. On August 26th [Yabut](https://web.archive.org/web/20160826170240/https:/twitter.com/jmprcx/status/769202859569246209) issued "[a declaration to the unnameable corporation](https://archive.fo/lVREZ)," obviously directed at the **Tor Project**.

> [In the past year, prominent researchers have been expelled, shamed, and ridiculed without due cause and we stand in support of them. Following their expulsion, the unnameable board was completely replaced in the style of state sponsored regime change.](https://archive.fo/lVREZ#selection-463.3125-463.3378)

> [Our first move in solidarity with those silenced will be to implement advanced features into our own network design. This move marks the beginning of your journey into deprecation. We will implement advanced chaff countermeasures to make our network superior. We will tirelessly devote our efforts into building a high entropy global network.](https://archive.fo/lVREZ#selection-463.3382-463.3727)

On September 12th, Yabut tweeted he had "[confirmed](https://web.archive.org/web/20160916155845/https:/twitter.com/movrcx/status/775392433274294273)" the existence of a Tor browser vulnerability, [threatening](https://web.archive.org/web/20160916182311/https:/twitter.com/movrcx/status/775392896795148290) to not only share it with the FBI & NSA but sell it on the exploit market if he was "[silenced](https://web.archive.org/web/20160916182643/https:/twitter.com/movrcx/status/775395927913791488)." On September 13th, Yabut [released](https://web.archive.org/web/20160913233554/https:/twitter.com/movrcx/status/775817614438400000) a public disclosure of the [remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in the Tor browser's auto-update mechanism](https://archive.fo/eh6jW); he also [noted](https://web.archive.org/web/20160916155454/https:/twitter.com/movrcx/status/776020197526343681) that [Appelbaum had raised a GitHub issue on certificate pinning](https://archive.fo/Roipz) back in February 2013. [Former U.S. Cyber Command member](https://archive.is/Qukhy#selection-2255.216-2255.337) [Ryan Duff](https://web.archive.org/web/20160916184639/https://twitter.com/flyryan) and [computer science PhD student](https://web.archive.org/web/20160916203205/https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~aatwater/) [Erinn Atwater](https://web.archive.org/web/20160916201030/https://twitter.com/errorinn) gave "[third-party verification](https://web.archive.org/web/20160916190721/https:/twitter.com/movrcx/status/776560673853730816)," [saying](https://web.archive.org/web/20160916155338/https:/twitter.com/flyryan/status/776136675927924736) in a [write-up](https://web.archive.org/web/20160915175506/https:/twitter.com/flyryan/status/776462943651233792) that the proposed "[attack as described by @movrcx should work as advertised](https://archive.is/eo3CT#selection-405.214-405.274)." (He later [published](https://web.archive.org/web/20160919163139/https:/twitter.com/flyryan/status/777876531494395904) a [*post mortem* report](https://archive.is/MjeW1) describing the vulnerability in more detail.) Hahn advised Firefox and Tor browser users to [disable automatic add-on updates](https://web.archive.org/web/20160916154113/https:/twitter.com/sebastianhahn/status/776620964863995905) for the time being. On September 16th, **Mozilla** [reportedly](https://web.archive.org/web/20160917163204/https://twitter.com/dangoodin001/status/776892277658521600) said they would [release a Firefox update on Tuesday](https://archive.is/P51ze#selection-1011.0-1011.175) (September 20th), while the [**Tor Project**](https://web.archive.org/web/20160916191357/https:/twitter.com/torproject/status/776776892951040000) released their own [browser update](https://web.archive.org/web/20160916154829/https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-605-released) ahead of [schedule](https://archive.is/MjeW1#selection-565.59-573.47) in response to the disclosure, attributing [credit](https://archive.is/Cjd7X#selection-139.12-141.30) for the [Firefox bug](https://archive.is/fWO3s) discovery only to Duff's write-up.

> That vulnerability allows an attacker who is able to obtain a valid certificate for addons.mozilla.org to impersonate Mozilla's servers and to deliver a malicious extension update, e.g. for NoScript. This could lead to arbitrary code execution. Moreover, other built-in certificate pinnings are affected as well.
