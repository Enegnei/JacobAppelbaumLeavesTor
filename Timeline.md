# Chronological Timeline

This is a *work-in-progress* chronological timeline of the **events** and **claims** detailed in the investigation. 
Due to its length and detail, many readers have difficulty following along and finding new entries.
Keep in mind that the dates of many **events** are disputed (as to when and / or whether they occurred).
If no precise date or window of time (e.g. within a month) has been found, the default date will be when the first known claim about it was published.

The first column uses YEAR / MONTH / DAY formatting. The third column references the section(s) where the event or claim is featured. 
If you would like to suggest a re-ordering or correction for particular events or claims, please submit a pull-request or open an '[Issue](https://github.com/Enegnei/JacobAppelbaumLeavesTor/issues).'
